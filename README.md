### About the site

The site runs with HUGO, using a modified version of the Hilton theme from [AnvodStudio](https://themeforest.net/user/anvodstudio). We've added in search functionality and switched the MailChimp signup for a newsletter run using Amazon SES, Mailbluster and a nifty bit of JavaScript.
