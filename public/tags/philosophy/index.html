            "content": "Next week, we\u0026rsquo;ll be running a workshop for lecturers at Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology called Finding and Communicating your Inspiration. We\u0026rsquo;re going to be working with members of academic staff across the university, exploring how storytelling can be used to more effectively communciate academic research. We\u0026rsquo;ve worked with a lot of academics in the past, both in groups and also through one-on-one mentoring. And one of the things we\u0026rsquo;re particularly proud of is how some of the projects that we\u0026rsquo;ve worked on have led to published, and critically-acclaimed, books.\nAs in all our work, the main question for us is always: what do you want to say? Writing is, first and foremost, about communication. And for researchers who want to get the word out about the important work they\u0026rsquo;re doing, communication is key. So in our workshop, we\u0026rsquo;ll be encouraging the writers and scholars we are working with to dive more deeply into the things that obsess them and the things they care about, and to think about how to communicate this as directly, effectively, and humanly as possible.\nAs writers who sometimes find ourselves writing outside the academic world, sometimes on the borders, and sometimes within the academy, we love projects that cross over between the academic world, and the wider world of readers and thinkers. And it\u0026rsquo;s always exciting to work with writers and scholars, helping them more effectively communicate the things that matter to them — and that matter to us all.\nImage: Paul Klee, Schicksalstunde um Dreiviertel (1922), public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\n",

You can see the project website here.\nAs a part of the residency, we held a public afternoon tea event, where we invited passers-by to come and drink tea, eat home-made scones, and share their stories. And we finished the residency with a public workshop at the StableNice Café, to share our insights and stories — as well as to encourage those who came along to share their own stories.\nIt was a real pleasure to work with the many writers and storytellers whom we met over the course of the ten days. And — as relatively new arrivals here in Tainan — it was a delightful way to make new connections. Because nothing connects like a cup of tea, and a shared story.\n",

We talked about the origins of Wind\u0026amp;Bones, our first-ever workshop, how we got our name, some of our favourite projects, and our upcoming residency at the Tainan Nanning Literature House (南寧文學·家).\nWe had so many questions from students about writing, about leading an organisation, about inspiration, about social change, and about how we keep positive when there\u0026rsquo;s so much suffering in the world.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re grateful to Dr. Ching-yueh Hsieh for inviting us and making us feel so welcome.

We think about these things a lot, so it\u0026rsquo;s been a delight to be visiting the seaside city of Busan in Korea, where we were at the World Humanities Forum, talking about Humanities in Relationship: Towards Communication, Coexistence and Empathy.\nWind\u0026amp;Bones\u0026rsquo;s Dr Will Buckingham was presenting a paper at the forum on how the idea of philoxenia — a term coming from Greek meaning \u0026ldquo;friendship with that which is other\u0026rdquo; — can help us think through the significance of museums for their visitors. Drawing on the work of the late Dr. Elee Kirk (see Elee\u0026rsquo;s book Snapshots of Museum Experience), and his own work in his book Hello, Stranger, Will\u0026rsquo;s paper explored the strange, quirky intimacy of what museums mean to their visitors — the way vistors are often far more idiosyncratic, less well-behaved, and more singular than researchers, educators or museum professionals either would like or, perhaps, can even imagine. Through thinking about the concept of philoxenia, he argued museum research needs a better, more attentive ethnography, and that the value of museums is often elsewhere than where we imagine it to be. The organiser of the panel was the brilliant museum scholar, Dr. Lena JE Lee, who also translated Elee\u0026rsquo;s book into Korean.\nIt was also lots of fun to meet readers of Hello, Stranger, which has been translated into Korean, with an absolutely gorgeous cover. The Korean title is great too: 타인이라는 가능성, which we\u0026rsquo;re told (we don\u0026rsquo;t know any Korean!) translates as “The Possibility of Strangers.” And the subtitle is 나의 세상을 확장하는 낯선 만남들에 대하여, or “On the encounters expanding my world.”\nAfter the forum, we were delighted to spend the day with Yong-June Park and Aram Hur from the wonderful Indigo Book Company — one of the great cultural powerhouses of Busan. Indigo is a haven for readers and thinkers, a place dedicated to humanistic education, and the home of Ecotopia restaurant, which serves amazingly tasty vegetarian and vegan food.\nLast year, Will did an online book event at Indigo to coincide with the launch of the Korean edition of Hello, Stranger, but this was our first time there in person, and it was an absolute delight. It was wonderful to connect with Yong-June and Aram, and to talk about everything from green spaces to Žižek (see this collection of interviews with Yong-June), and from the contemporary challenges of publishing to the role of education in bringing about positive social change.\nWe left Busan with very full stomachs, equally full heads and hearts, and lots of plans and ideas for future collaborations.\n",

We shared and wrote stories in multiple languages, whilst at the same time an exercise class was taking part in another corner of the hall, and lunch being served in yet another.\nSince then, our understanding of storytelling and the power of storytelling has increased immeasurably. So we’re delighted that Wind\u0026amp;Bones\u0026rsquo;s Dr Will Buckingham has been commissioned to write a Liberal Arts and Sciences Strengthening Guide on storytelling for the Open Society University Network (OSUN).\nOSUN is a global network of higher education institutions committed to the idea that the primary role of education is to support open societies. These are societies based on democratic practice, sustainability, addressing inequalities, a commitment to human rights and global justice, the promotion of global public health, and a commitment to the pivotal role played by the arts. Both Will and Hannah from Wind\u0026amp;Bones work for Parami University, a part of the OSUN network — Hannah in the Insitute of Continuing Education, and Will in the Institute of Undergraduate Studies.\nThe guide is called Storytelling in the Multilingual and Multicultural Classroom: Community, Communication, Confidence, and Connection, and will be available some time next year. The project will give us the opportunity to share the fruits of our experience and expertise from the past seven years with educators across the OSUN network. Over this time, we’ve developed and perfected some powerful methods for working on storytelling across differences of language and culture. We have run projects in Myanmar, Indonesia, Taiwan, Bulgaria, Scotland, England, Ireland and elsewhere, and we have met some astonishing, wonderful, and deeply committed storytellers, activists, writers, and champions of social justice. So we’re looking forward to drawing together some of our insights and know-how into a guide that will inspire others to use storytelling to bring about positive change.\nImage: Title page illustration by Ethel Franklin Betts, The Orphant Annie Book, by James Whitcomb Riley, Indianapolis: Bobbs‐Merrill Co., 1908.

            "content": "This August, we\u0026rsquo;ll be packing our bags, and heading over to Taiwan. We were last in Taiwan four years ago, on a short visit from Myanmar, and we found ourselves smitten. In particular, while in Tainan (our favourite Taiwanese city), we visited the National Museum of Taiwan Literature, and we were enormously impressed by the nuanced and thoughtful take on the ways in which literature can act as a driver of positive social change.\nBack then, we thought it might be fun to run some projects in Taiwan. And we aimed to get back much sooner to cook up some fun and interesting things — but Covid and life intervened. So it was only this year that the time felt right to put in applications for work visas, or Taiwan Gold Cards. Our applications were accepted, so this will allow us to run Wind\u0026amp;Bones projects on a freelance basis in Taiwan.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll base ourselves in Tainan (better weather than Taipei, lower cost of living, and a city that we really like). And after we\u0026rsquo;ve sorted out a place to live, we\u0026rsquo;ll start catching up with old friends, making new friends, and cooking up some fun new projects. This will give another opportunity to develop our long-standing interest in working on projects that cross between cultures and languages (see here, for example). While in Taiwan, we\u0026rsquo;ll both also be writing and researching some new projects. And Will is going to making the most of the chance to put to use his skills in Chinese, and to develop his still rudimentary Taiwanese.\nImage: Fort Zeelandia Dragons by Benjamin Arnold.

            "tags": ["wind\u0026bones","interview",],
            "content": "Two years ago, we recorded this interview with the brilliant travel writer, Dr Tim Hannigan. At the time, Tim was working on the Credne project at Dublin City University, exploring the nature of creativity.\nTim was a great interviewer: friendly, enthusiastic and astute, and as a result, the interview gives a really good overview of our work at Wind\u0026amp;Bones. The interview below is very lightly edited. Happy reading!\nOn creativity Tim Hello, Will and Hannah. I\u0026rsquo;m going to start with our standard opening question: What single word do you associate with the concept of \u0026ldquo;Creativity\u0026rdquo;?\nHannah Difference — I think creativity is rooted in our individuality and our own unique experiences and perspectives on the world. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely richer for that.\nWill Delight — people like the idea of the suffering artist, but creativity is a kind of play, it involves pleasure.\nJourneys Tim Will, as well as travelling widely in person, you also travelled widely in terms of discipline during your academic career - from anthropology to philosophy, to somewhere in the vicinity of literary studies, or certainly creative writing. How would \u0026ldquo;creativity\u0026rdquo; be viewed in those different disciplines, and has your own perspective on creativity travelled to new places during your disciplinary journeys?\nWill It has been a strange itinerary. I started out as an art student. So I spent four years in art school. And although this didn\u0026rsquo;t make me an artist, in the end, it was an incredibly creative period. I read lots, and somewhere along the way, I decided to become an anthropologist. I cobbled together some funds from various grants, and ended up in a remote village in eastern Indonesia, where I spent six months studying the work of local wood-carvers.\nI came back from Indonesia and did an MA in anthropology, then I crashed out of a PhD due to a tropical illness I picked up in Indonesia. After that, I spent about a decade practising Buddhism, and eventually wound up going back to do a PhD in philosophy.\nMy interests are still pretty much related to anthropology and philosophy. But I don\u0026rsquo;t really see myself belonging to literary studies. I spent the best part of a decade teaching in an English Literature department until I left academia five years ago. But I never really worked out what those folks were up to. For me, writing is about communication, and it is about exploring the world. But I\u0026rsquo;m not much preoccupied with questions of literature, or what it is.\nI think Joan Didion said that she wrote to find out what she thought. And I do the same. Since leaving full-time academia, I no longer have anything like an academic career. But this has certain advantages. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about disciplinary boundaries. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about what kinds of research are going to go down well with university committees. And so on. And this means that in this process of exploration, I am more or less free to go in whatever direction I like.\nAs for creativity, I see it as something fundamental to what makes us human. The thing I learned from anthropology is that human beings are hugely flexible. We organise ourselves in all kinds of different ways. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take long studying anthropology to see that your own way of going about life is culturally determined, and only one possible way of doing things. And my understanding of philosophy is similar: philosophy could be seen as the invention of new ways of thinking about, and seeing, the world. So for me, what is interesting is the diversity of human ways of being and thinking. And in this, creativity and invention are fundamental. They are not special skills, or add-ons, or things only certain people have. Human beings are naturally inventive. We\u0026rsquo;re naturally creative. Hannah, your academic background is a bit more constant, in English and creative writing. There\u0026rsquo;s sometimes a prejudice or preconception that creative writing, as something very much about creative practice, sits awkwardly in formal academia. How do you see its place within academia? And how do you see creativity and criticality, scholarship and practice, intersecting?\nHannah My academic background looks pretty constant, I think, on the surface at least. But the journey there certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t. I\u0026rsquo;m from a working-class background and went to a really deprived inner-city school in Leicester. Some of the teachers were exceptional, and I did well at my GCSEs. But it felt right at the time that I\u0026rsquo;d leave school and rather than do A-levels, I\u0026rsquo;d go and do something trade or skills related. So I trained as a beauty therapist. I\u0026rsquo;m really interested in people and their experiences, so this was a way of meeting lots of interesting, yet ordinary people and hearing curious insights in to the lives that were happening around me.\nI loved English at school, but I also loved science too and my beauty therapy qualification was very science focussed. And so, after my beauty therapy qualification, I actually started a Biomedical science degree. The plan was to explore my science interests and continue working part-time. At the time, I found the university setting quite intimidating. And I also realised that the degree funnelled us into very narrow options… mainly quite isolated lab work, and so I dropped out because this really didn\u0026rsquo;t appeal to me.\nSo afterwards, I worked as a beauty therapist and counter assistant in various department stores for a number of years. I really enjoyed working with different people and collected a lot of stories over the years, I guess. But I was often treated as though I was a bit of a bimbo. Not by clients, but generally when I told people what I did and that really grated after a while. After a few years, I wanted a change. I\u0026rsquo;d started writing in an ad-hoc way and wanted to study in a more formal way. So I did an access course in humanities at college. I loved the experience. The syllabus was so broad and there was a really interesting mix of mature students there. This allowed to me to go on to a degree in creative writing and English. Which I also loved… Particularly the creative element. So that\u0026rsquo;s how I ended up in creative writing, and that\u0026rsquo;s where I eventually did my PhD.\nIn terms of creative writing and formal academia: I really think creative writing needs to move away from the English department. It would be much more at home with the other artists and creators. I need time, a nice space and interaction with people to be creative. Studio spaces offer all of that. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a myth that writing is a solitary endeavour. At least for me. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think you can cook up your best work in a two-hour session in a dingy classroom. So I would move creative writing in to the art department, and we\u0026rsquo;d all have studio spaces to be creative and drink lots of tea together.\nBorderlands Tim Will and Hannah - you now both operate around the borders of academia, often teaching in higher education settings, or working with academics, but without a formal institutional affiliation. Are there benefits to that, in particular when it comes to encouraging creativity amongst those you teach? Would being fully embedded within academia restrict creativity?\nWill Absolutely. We have both spent portions of our live in academia and outside, and although there\u0026rsquo;s a lot we like about the academic world, it\u0026rsquo;s a hard place for creativity to thrive. Not just for those working in academia (although that can be true) but also for students. For example, one thing about creativity is it involves experimentation. And one thing about experimentation is that experiments often don\u0026rsquo;t work out. But when there\u0026rsquo;s a deadline looming, and you know you will be graded, it is very easy to play it safe. This means not experimenting, but just turning something out that is solid but takes no risks. And, in fact, this is often the rational choice for students. But it isn\u0026rsquo;t the creative one.\nThere are ways of mitigating this. You could ditch grading for most assignments, for example, to encourage experimentation. And I agree with what Hannah says about English departments. If we had our way, creative writing courses would be liberated from English departments, and we\u0026rsquo;d have a model closer to that of Fine Arts. One thing I\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in is the kinds of spaces that foster creativity. Studio spaces do. But university classrooms often don\u0026rsquo;t.\nAs for our own work, we like being on the margins. It\u0026rsquo;s a place where you can experiment, take risks, and also have the freedom to focus on communication and creativity, without worrying about the instrumental demands of the academic world. Look at any medieval manuscript. There are lines of well-copied text. But in the margins, the scribes have added all kinds of strange illustrations: misbehaving animals, bishops, nuns, courtiers, and so on. The margins are where the fun stuff happens.\nHannah Yes, I agree with Will. I like being on the margins. We can really focus on the importance of communication, expression and creativity without the pressures of conforming to university measures of success.\nWind\u0026amp;Bones - origins Tim Hannah, can you tell us about Wind\u0026amp;Bones? What was the idea behind it, and what kind of work do you do?\nHannah We set up in 2017 after running a series of creative writing workshops with refugees and asylum seekers in Leicester.\nDuring the workshop, participants shared stories of their homes and journeys, and experiences. It was really moving. And also really fun. Which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily expecting. And it was lovely to connect with people from hugely diverse backgrounds and to build a community.\nIt became clear during these workshops how powerful a tool writing was in terms of building community, connecting different groups of people and fostering positive social change. So we really wanted to continue doing that and doing it with all kinds of different people in different contexts.\nAs a result, we set up Wind\u0026amp;Bones. The name comes from a medieval Chinese text on the art of writing called The Carving of Dragons and the Literary Mind. In the text, it says that good writing needs both wind, or life and energy, and bones, or structure and organisation. We thought this was good advice for writing, but also good advice for bringing about social change, and for life in general.\nOur remit is pretty broad. We want to explore writing and creativity, and we want to see how these things can be used to make a positive difference in the world. In 2018, we were invited to run some workshops and events at the Ubud Writers\u0026rsquo; and Readers Festival, and then to run an eight-month writing residency in Yangon, Myanmar. So this really kick-started our work. In Myanmar, we worked with grassroots educational organisations, community teacher training colleges and civil society organisations to develop their storytelling skills. And we also ran classes with journalists, former political prisoners, NGO workers, students and activists, to explore writing and social change.\nSince then, we\u0026rsquo;ve worked in Greek refugee camps, on a range of educational projects in Sofia (where we\u0026rsquo;re based at the moment) and soon we\u0026rsquo;ll be working on a really exciting new project with survivors of domestic abuse. Alongside all of this, we\u0026rsquo;ve been continuing to work mentoring individual writers: our students have included oral historians, fantasy writers, and a tenured professor of Chinese history.\nCrossing languages and cultures Tim Will, you\u0026rsquo;ve taught and run workshops in a very wide range of cultural and educational contexts - in different countries, and with very different groups of people. Do the underpinning approaches to creativity and creative writing travel well across those different contexts? Are there any particular challenges? What about teaching creativity across language barriers?\nWill With our work for Wind\u0026amp;Bones, this has been a learning curve for us. Traditions of writing, storytelling and so on are different in different places. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t take long, when exploring creativity in these cross-cultural contexts, before you realise that what is taken to be solid creative writing advice — or creativity advice in general — is more like a kind of rag-bag of folk-remedies. And these remedies are relevant only in particular places, and perhaps not as curative as we might hope. One of the things that we\u0026rsquo;ve become more sensitive to is the ways in which creativity manifests in different ways in different places.\nBut also theories of creativity differ from place to place too. With my philosopher\u0026rsquo;s hat on, I\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in this. One thing I\u0026rsquo;ve been obsessed by for years is the Wenxin diaolong or The Heart of Literature and the Carving of Dragons… It\u0026rsquo;s by the medieval Chinese writer Liu Xie, and provides a hugely powerful account of creativity, but one that also feels fresh and new to readers like myself who come from the Western philosophical tradition. So there are huge untapped theoretical resources out there as well, once we start thinking about creativity cross-culturally.\nAlongside recognising the divergent ways that creativity manifests, and the divergent theories of creativity that there are, in all our work, we recognise that underlying this, creativity is a general human trait (however you define it). People like making new stuff. They like discovering things. They like play.\nAnd this is why teaching across language barriers can be so fun. Because these various approaches to creativity collide in creative ways. The more we do this kind of thing, the less we think that these linguistic puzzles are actually barriers. Communicating and storytelling can take place across and between all kinds of languages — ones you speak fluently, badly or not at all. So playing around with this has all kinds of creative possibilities.\nTim Hannah, do you want to say something about this?\nHannah Absolutely. One of the challenges is not to impose our own narrow ideas of what creativity is and what it can be. So we have to be sensitive to this difference and diversity., because this is one of the strengths and where the fun lies.\nComing from an academic creative writing background, there are all kinds of things you internalise about how stories should be told. But this is only one storytelling tradition. But human beings everywhere are storytelling creatures, and they do this in typically idiosyncratic ways. So it\u0026rsquo;s fun to explore with writers from different backgrounds what it is that makes a story worth telling, and how they can connect with different audiences.\nBuilding creative communities Tim Hannah, creativity in general - and perhaps creative writing in particular - is sometimes seen as an individualistic thing, something connected to personal fulfilment. But at Wind\u0026amp;Bones you explicitly tie writing and creativity to social change. Can you tell us more about that? What role do writing and creativity have in fostering social change?\nHannah This idea of writing as being mainly about yourself and your own fulfilment is itself culturally specific. And it\u0026rsquo;s also quite weird. Fulfilment doesn\u0026rsquo;t come from just fulfilling yourself. It comes from connecting with other people. Because none of us exist in a vacuum. We all relate to other people in some way. And so with our Wind\u0026amp;Bones work, we start from the point of view that writing is about communication. It is interpersonal first and foremost. And only after that is it personal. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how little emphasis is put on this in academic approaches to creative writing. We think about the writer, and we think about the text they are writing. And we think about the relationship between the two. But we don\u0026rsquo;t really think hard enough about writing as an act of communication. We don\u0026rsquo;t think about who we are writing for, and about trying to connect with other human beings.\nSo we put this centre-stage in our work with Wind\u0026amp;Bones. And in some ways, questions of social change naturally follow from this. If you see writing as individualistic, then it becomes very hard to see how it can change anything at all beyond our own selves. But if you see writing as interpersonal, then everything you write, every story you tell, has some kind of social impact.\nWith Wind\u0026amp;Bones, we want to foreground this question of the social nature of writing. We\u0026rsquo;re storytelling animals. And storytelling is interpersonal. So we want to put centre-stage the fact that writing is about communication. And why do we communicate? We communicate because we want to change things. We want to make deeper links with each other. We want to persuade others of our point of view. We want to address problems that trouble us. And so on.\nThis means that social change is at the heart of everything we do. It\u0026rsquo;s not an add-on. It\u0026rsquo;s just what stories do.\nWill Absolutely! I have nothing to add\nTim Will and Hannah, as educators, what can we do to promote a culture of creativity in general, beyond any specific subject or discipline, and to cultivate students\u0026rsquo; creative ability?\nWill The first thing for me is trust. Often creative writing training is seen as giving people particular skills that they don\u0026rsquo;t have, or telling them how to do stuff. But our approach is based on a really deep trust that people are already creative: it\u0026rsquo;s a kind of trust in individuals — there is no such thing as an uncreative person —, but also in the flexibility, playfulness, powers of invention that human beings naturally have. Often our job is to point people to this thing that is already there, rather than giving them something they haven\u0026rsquo;t yet got.\nHannah: This is reflected in the way we run our sessions. First and foremost, we aim to set a tone of friendliness, with minimum hierarchy, so that people can connect on a deeply human level. There are some terrible creative writing classes out there where the great (often male) writer hands down judgements on students\u0026rsquo; work, like some minor god. And maybe one or two people might benefit from this kind of thing. But as a general approach to teaching creativity, it is absolutely terrible. So instead, we start from establishing this friendliness and trust, and get people talking, sharing stories, seeing the effect of their storytelling on each other. And from this beginning, amazing things start to happen.\nWork in progress Tim Will and Hannah, what are your most recent publications/projects?\nWill My most recent project is Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World, which is coming out soon from Granta. It\u0026rsquo;s a book about how to develop more openness, more hospitality, towards strangers. And about how this openness can transform our lives and our communities. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say that it is an easy thing to do. So while I talk in the book about all the things that can go right with this process of opening-up — drawing on philosophy, anthropology and storytelling — I also talk about all the things that can go wrong.\nHannah My short story collection In their Absence was published early this year by Roman Books. It\u0026rsquo;s a collection of short stories based on the theme of missing people. In the UK, 176,000 people are reported missing every year and the reasons for people going missing hugely vary. Through this collection, I aimed to explore the human complexities of this. I researched the phenomenon of missing people extensively during my PhD and the collection resulted from this.\nCurrently, I\u0026rsquo;m working on a new short story collection called On the Bodies of Strangers which is a collection loosely linked by the theme of tattoos.\nIn terms of Wind\u0026amp;Bones projects, later this year we\u0026rsquo;ll be working on a writing and storytelling project with survivors of domestic abuse. We\u0026rsquo;re partnering with an excellent Sofia-based organisation called Emprove. And the project is funded by the British Embassy here in Sofia. So we\u0026rsquo;re really excited about that.

            "content": "Happy New Year from Madeira, where we are taking a working break for a couple of weeks. While here in Funchal, we\u0026rsquo;re looking over what we have done in 2022 and making plans for 2023.\n2022 in Review Wind\u0026amp;Bones move to Scotland Last year was incredibly busy. The most significant change was that we moved from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Dundee, Scotland. After almost 2½ years working in Bulgaria, we felt like we needed to reconnect to our UK roots, so we moved up to Scotland.\nOne quirk of UK company law is that you can\u0026rsquo;t move a business over the border from England to Scotland. So, as Wind\u0026amp;Bones CIC was registered in Leicester, we set about dissolving the old company and setting up a shiny new Wind\u0026amp;Bones CIC based in Dundee. It was a slightly complicated process (you can read about it here), but by the summer, we had our new company in place.\nFood, Glorious Food Food production, distribution, and preparation are all a central part of human well-being. So some of our projects in 2022 were related to food: where the food we eat comes from, how to make food production sustainable, how food intersects with history, community, culture, and identity.\nShortly after arriving in Scotland, we got involved with the brilliant folks at the Dandelion festival. This led to us running a three-day public workshop at Dandelion Festival Glasgow, harvesting micro-stories about food from the public. You can find out more about what we did by going to our virtual story garden.\nNot long after this, we were over in Waterford, Ireland, with the lovely GIY (Ireland) crew, for their Waterford Harvest Festival, a three-day celebration of “food done right.” Not only did we eat some exceptional food, but we also spent time harvesting more stories from the people of Waterford.\nOn our final day in Waterford, we also had the enormous pleasure of co-running a workshop with Dr Sarah Prosser, developing a manifesto for food futures in the Waterford Bioregion.\nMyanmar Projects We continue to be concerned about the situation in Myanmar, and to work with Myanmar-based organisations on projects that can help with alleviating some of the profound difficulties that have resulted from the coup of 2021.\nWe started the year by running an ethical leadership class for the Parami Institute, based in Yangon. This was based on the work we have done with the educational NGO Mote Oo, developing a course on ethics and leadership for grassroots and community groups based in Myanmar.\nWe also ran a project later in the year working with Myanmar-based teachers on storytelling as a tool for classroom education.\nAwakening Between the Lines In the summer, we spent six weeks back in Bulgaria. During that time, we visited the National Gallery of Bulgaria to see the exhibition from the Awakening Between the Lines project we co-delivered with the Emprove Foundation. For this project, we worked with a group of women survivors of domestic abuse writing a collection of micro-stories in both English and Bulgarian. The resulting stories were cross-translated and accompanied by images produced by Bulgarian illustrators and artists.\nNot only did the project lead to an exhibition in the national gallery, but the stories have now been printed as a boxed set of beautiful story-cards. Each card features a single story — in both Bulgarian and English — and, on the reverse side, a beautiful image.\nHeading South We finished the year with a couple of weeks south of the border in England. At De Montfort University in Leicester, Will ran a Wind\u0026amp;Bones workshop in storytelling and effective communication with a small group of art students. Then we headed down to London, where we met students at the London College of Communication. Students in magazine publishing and marketing are using our work at Wind\u0026amp;Bones as a case-study, exploring how we can develop our brand and our profile. We are really excited to see what they come up with when the results of this pilot come flooding in, some time in the middle of January.\nWriting, Writing, Writing Individually, we\u0026rsquo;ve also been busy working on writing projects. Hannah secured a £5000 grant from Creative Scotland to write her first novel, an exploration of abuse and coercive control in queer communities. Meanwhile, both Hannah and Will signed contracts for their short story collections In their Absence and Sixty-Four Chance Pieces to be translated into Bulgarian. The books are coming out in Bulgaria next year.\n2022 was also the 10th anniversary of the publication of Will\u0026rsquo;s children\u0026rsquo;s book, The Snorgh and the Sailor. To mark the occasion, Scholastic published a beautiful new edition. And also in the summer, Will\u0026rsquo;s Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World came out in paperback from Granta books.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve got all kinds of writing projects in the work for next year as well. We\u0026rsquo;ll keep you all posted.\nMentoring 2022 has been a good year for some of our mentees as well. A couple of years back, we worked with Dr Angela Stienne on her book Mummified: The stories behind Egyptian mummies in museums, and we were delighted to see the book published — in a beautiful edition — by Manchester University Press.\nWe also worked with Dr Ariane Karbe on her book proposal for Museum Exhibitions and Suspense: The Use of Screenwriting Techniques in Curatorial Practice, and are really excited to see the book out in the wild — at the time of writing, just a few weeks old!\nYou can find out more about our mentoring here.\nInto the New Year\u0026hellip; So what do we have planned for 2023? First up, we\u0026rsquo;ve got a new partnership with the Premise Institute, and we\u0026rsquo;re running our first partner workshop with them on February 4th 2023. You can find out more here. We\u0026rsquo;ve also been speaking to friends at Trade Sexual Health in Leicester, and Blunt Knife in Edinburgh about possible collaborations. And we\u0026rsquo;ve just relaunched our Looking for Wisdom project, and have big plans there as well.\nFinally, we\u0026rsquo;ve got a very exciting project that — for the next couple of weeks at least — is still under wraps. It\u0026rsquo;s to do with writing, and philosophy, and social change, and cross-cultural approaches to creativity, and… well, pretty much all the things that we care about. But we\u0026rsquo;re not quite ready to announce that yet!\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s more or less where we\u0026rsquo;re up to! Happy New Year, wherever you are in the world. And do get in touch if you want to say hello, or cook up any collaborations together.\nHannah \u0026amp; Will\n",

            "content": "Last week, we were at the British Ambassador\u0026rsquo;s Residence in Sofia for a fundraising event with the Emprove Foundation for our Awakening Between the Lines Project. Here\u0026rsquo;s the speech we wrote for the event.\nGood evening. I\u0026rsquo;m Will Buckingham, co-director of Wind\u0026amp;Bones, and over there is my colleague and Wind\u0026amp;Bones co-director Hannah Stevens. Wind\u0026amp;Bones is a social enterprise now based in Scotland, and we run projects at the intersection of writing, creativity and social change.\nEarly last year, when we were still living in Sofia, Hannah contacted Olia at Emprove, saying we should work together. Olia\u0026rsquo;s response was warm, immediate and wildly enthusiastic. So together, we came up with a plan for a storytelling project working with women survivors of abuse. From the start, we knew that what we wanted above all was to make something beautiful, something meaningful, and something transformative.\nAt Wind\u0026amp;Bones and Emprove, we share the belief that the issue of domestic abuse, in Bulgaria as elsewhere, is still under-reported, under-resourced, and widely misunderstood. And we also are united in the conviction that to tackle this issue, storytelling is one of the most powerful tools we have.\nSo this is what this project has been about: from its first beginnings, to the brilliant exhibition at National Gallery, Sofia, to the publication that is forthcoming. And we have been able to do all of this great work thanks to the generous funding and support of British Embassy, Sofia, for which we are very grateful.\nWe kicked off the project late last year with a series of intensive storytelling workshops with a group of women survivors, many of whom are here tonight. In the workshops, we wrote and shared stories in Bulgarian and English. And perhaps it might surprise you that although we were dealing with the most difficult of subjects, the one thing that characterised these workshops was the sense of life and of laughter.\nThe women writers with whom we worked, whom we now count among our friends, are an incredibly impressive group of human beings. Their stories are a testimony to their experiences. They are a testimony to the harms done by domestic abuse. But more than anything, they are also a testimony to the possibilities for a better world when we start to tackle this most urgent of issues. Only when we start to speak more about abuse, about those who perpetrate it, and those who suffer it, can we bring about the transformation we need.\nAt Wind\u0026amp;Bones, we believe that harmful stories can be countered best by more stories, and by better stories. Stories that help us together reimagine and rebuild our shared world. And this task of reimagining ourselves, each other and our society is a collective responsibility, whoever we are and whatever our gender.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s a true pleasure to be here tonight celebrating these extraordinary women writers, their remarkable stories, and the beautiful artworks that accompany these stories.\nAnd because the more stories the better, throughout this evening, Hannah and I will be asking for your stories. And as this evening\u0026rsquo;s event is all about freedom, we\u0026rsquo;ll be asking you to share stories about freedom. We\u0026rsquo;ll be over there throughout the evening at the table, with these story-cards where you can come and write, in whatever language you choose. We\u0026rsquo;ll be adorning the trees here with stories and, we hope, capturing some of them for posterity.\nSo to finish, it\u0026rsquo;s great to see a large crowd of you here to celebrate. This event is about connecting, and it is about storytelling. But, of course, it is also about fundraising. There are many ways you can contribute to this vital work. So what we want to ask of you is this: please be bold, be open to possibility, and be generous. And let\u0026rsquo;s use this as a precious opportunity to connect, to rethink and to reimagine so that we can make the world a little better.\nWe wish you all a very good evening.\n",

Overview We worked with the Emprove Foundation and British Embassy, Bulgaria, on an innovative project to raise awareness of the issue of domestic abuse. Emprove Foundation work with women survivors of abuse. For this project, we ran a six-week intensive workshop on writing for a group of women survivors.\nThe stories were edited into final form and cross-translated between Bulgarian and English. We also worked closely with Bulgarian poet Nadezhda Radulova on the translations. The final stories were exhibited alongside commissioned artworks at the National Gallery of Bulgaria. The stories were also published as a boxed set of story cards.\nProject Outcomes Exhibition at the National Gallery of Bulgaria Kvadrat 500 In the summer of 2022, the National Gallery of Bulgaria held a two-month-long exhibition called Awakening Between the Lines / Пробуждане между редовете, exhibiting the stories in Bulgarian and English and the commissioned artworks.\nStory cards The stories have now been published as a boxed set of cards. On the front of the cards are the commissioned illustrations, and on the back of the cards are the stories in both languages.

These artworks are the subject of an exhibition that is currently running in The National Gallery of Bulgaria Kvadrat 500.\nThe initial stories were written in English and Bulgarian, and from these versions, we worked on editing English-language final drafts. These are being translated into Bulgarian by the brilliant poet, Nadezhda Radulova. In the next stage of the project, the Bulgarian/English versions will be printed on a beautiful set of cards that will be available to purchase as a boxed set, and that can also be used for training, and for raising awareness of the issue of domestic abuse in Bulgaria and beyond.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll be back in Bulgaria for an event on the 13th July hosted by British Embassy, Sofia, to kick-start the fund-raising for the next stage of this project. There will be more stories to be told and shared, music, and a lot of fun.\nThe images here are Mother by Mila Tabakova, Forgiveness by Borislava Karadzhova, Without mud there is no lotus by Adriana Gersimova and A story that liberates by Antonia Mechkueva, as well as a couple of pictures from Emprove of the launch.\nAwakening Between the Lines ",

Over six weeks between November and December this year, we\u0026rsquo;ll be working with a group of women survivors, exploring how storytelling can be used to build community and bring about both individual and social transformation.\nThe project will lead to the following\nan overarching communication campaign, combining face-to-face events with capacity-building measures the production of an illustrated series of story-cards with text written by women survivors the development of a first of its kind creative writing curriculum for domestic violence survivors in Bulgaria. An exhibition of artworks based on the stories. A big launch event for the exhibition, with readings of the stories from actors, in both Bulgarian and English. The stories shared in the group will become the basis for a series of beautiful, inspiring artist-illustrated cards with stories written by survivors in both English and Bulgarian, to be published in 2022. The cards will come as a boxed set and be available in bookshops across Bulgaria.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re hugely excited by this project, which has been a long time in the making. In Bulgaria, as elsewhere, domestic abuse and domestic violence are still huge issues. Working with the brilliant Emprove Foundation, with this project we are aiming to contribute to public awareness of these issues, both in Bulgaria and regionally. And we are wanting to build more robust, supportive communities among survivors.\nThe project is part-funded by the British Embassy, Sofia, and we are very grateful for their support. The course is timed to tie in with the UN\u0026rsquo;s International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Data from the previous year and a half has shown that since the beginning of Covid-19, domestic violence and abuse has intensified across the world. UN Women refer to this as a \u0026ldquo;Shadow Pandemic\u0026rdquo;.\nOur aim with this collaboration is to increase awareness of domestic abuse here in Bulgaria, to empower the women survivors who take part, and to train Emprove staff in techniques in facilitating storytelling sessions, so that they can develop this work further within the Bulgarian context.\n",

The project was launched formally on January 1st this year. Since then, it has grown quickly, with now over sixty articles covering the world\u0026rsquo;s philosophy — from ancient China to Classical Greece, from the riches of the Islamic philosophical tradition to the fascinating world of Mesoamerican thought. It aims to make the world\u0026rsquo;s philosophical traditions accessible, while broadening out our ideas of what philosophy is, and what it could be.\nLooking for Wisdom also has a members-only community for those who want to take their study of philosophy deeper. And later this summer, there will be workshops and seminars added in to the mix.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re super-excited by this new collaboration. Philosophy is, in part, about the stories we weave about the world. And exploring the richness of these traditions of philosophy can help us tell new stories, and find more creative responses to the challenges we all face.\nIf you want to sign up for Looking for Wisdom, CLICK THIS LINK.\n",

            "content": "When we set up Wind\u0026amp;Bones back in 2018, we wanted a name that reflected our vision of writing, creativity and social change. And after a lot of discussion, eventually we came up with Wind\u0026amp;Bones.\nBut what\u0026rsquo;s in a name? And why are we called this? Is one of us \u0026ldquo;Wind\u0026rdquo; and one of us \u0026ldquo;Bones\u0026rdquo;? Are these our secret superhero names? Alas, no! But the real story is fun and interesting too, and it goes back to medieval China.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s in a name? The reason goes back to an old Chinese book called The Heart of Literature, and the Carving of Dragons, written some time at the turn of the sixth century.\nThe writer of the book was Liu Xie, a thinker who brought together the various philosophical and literary traditions of medieval China to write a beautiful, insightful text about the art of writing and, indirectly, the art of living.\nWhen we were reading Liu\u0026rsquo;s book, one passage in particular caught our eye: the part where Liu says that writers should \u0026ldquo;cultivate the vigour of the wind, and make the bone robust\u0026rdquo; (or, in Chinese, 蔚彼風力，嚴此骨鯁).\nVigour and rigour This idea of wind and bones is so important to Liu that he dedicates a whole chapter to it. In Chinese, this chapter is called feng gu (風骨). Feng means \u0026ldquo;wind\u0026rdquo;, while gu means \u0026ldquo;bone.\u0026rdquo; And in the brief span of a couple of pages, Liu brilliantly argues how good literature is born out of a marriage of these two things. To write, Liu says, you need wind — liveliness and spiritedness and vigour. But you also need bones — structure, and organisation, and rigour.\nWind\u0026amp;Bones, vigour and rigour: for us, this seemed to capture something essential to the art of writing. When you are writing, at times things get too bony—your writing is organised, it is beautifully structured, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t spring to life. Or at other times, things are too windy. There\u0026rsquo;s energy and life, but everything is all over the place, and the energy is not well-channelled or well-organised.\nBut if you get the balance right — if your writing has both vigour and rigour, wind and bones — then things really start to happen.\nThe more we thought about this, the more we thought that this balancing of wind and bones was good advice not only for writing, but for creativity of all kinds, for social change, and for life. As a name, it captured the spirit of what we are doing in all our work.\nA global view of writing \u0026amp; creativity But there was another reason we liked the name as well. We wanted a name that reflected a commitment to a more global vision of literature.\nAs creative writers we work almost exclusively in English. But the brilliant and talented writers with whom we work come from multiple literary traditions, and as writers we draw widely on works in translation, from all over the world. We have learned a lot about creativity and writing from writers from non-Anglophone traditions.\nSo we wanted a name that paid honour to this diversity, and that could serve as a reminder that this business of carving dragons (and other things too) by fashioning words on the page was something all writers share, whatever their language and whatever the traditions on which they draw.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the story of why we settled on Wind\u0026amp;Bones!\nImage: Section of Chen Rong, nine dragons (1244) via Wikimedia Commons.\n",

            "content": "At Wind\u0026amp;Bones, one myth we’re keen to dispel is the myth of the suffering artist. One of the things we do when working with writers is help them find ways to seek out delight and pleasure in their writing. Because once you have pleasure and delight, you have energy and life, and when you have energy and life, you are already half-way to creating something worthwhile.\nOf course, writing can be difficult (tell us about it). But difficulty is not the same as suffering. So have a read of this piece by Wind\u0026amp;Bones’s Will Buckingham, about the Finnish writer Tove Jansson, the perniciousness of the myth of suffering for your art, and how to seek out delight, whatever you want to create.\nOne reason that the idea of the suffering artist is so very pernicious is that it dulls our instincts for pleasure and delight. And it eclipses the central role that pleasure plays in creating anything of value. The myth of suffering for your art teaches us that pleasure is an indication that something is wrong, a worrying sign of our superficiality. And this idea is fatal for our creative well-being.\nREAD THE ARTICLE HERE.\n",

            "content": "In this post, we’re featuring the fabulous Maisie Chan. Read our wide-ranging interview about writing, representation, the ongoing harms of orientalism, and the dedication it takes to be a damn good storyteller.\nHello, Maisie. It’s great to talk to you. We’re particularly excited because you are the first writer in our Inspirations series, where we feature writers committed to using their words to make the world a better place. This is a really exciting time to be talking to you because you’ve got not one, but two books coming out in the coming few months: Danny Chung Does Not Do Maths (Piccadilly Press), published in the USA as Danny Chung Sums it Up (Amulet Books), and Tiger Warrior: Attack of the Dragon King (Orchard Books).\nSo, first off, can you tell us a bit about your background, and how you first got into writing? I was in my late twenties when I knew I wanted to be a writer. I thought about becoming a teacher multiple times as I liked working with children, but something always made me come back to being an author. I was a trust fundraiser for a few years, where I honed my writing skills, though asking for money wasn’t my strength!\nI talked about “being a writer” before I put pen to paper. I had a group of friends telling me to go for it. I applied to a Birmingham Libraries mentoring scheme and got a place. My short story was published in an anthology, and I was the first British Chinese writer to appear at the Birmingham Book Festival (as it was known back then).\nSoon after, I gained a place on the National Academy of Writing Course at Birmingham City University with Nicola Monaghan, Jackie Gay and Richard Beard as my tutors. I learned a lot about the industry and tried different forms of writing, however, I didn’t know then I was going to be a children’s author. I did have it in the back of my mind that I ALSO wanted to write for children, but I didn’t look into it much. I remember writing a terrible yoga-inspired picture book called Bendy Wendy. I didn’t realise how much more you need to do than just sit down and write a picture book. You have to learn the craft and write some not-so-good-stuff before you write the stories that get published.\nActually, Will (from Wind\u0026amp;Bones) was the first person to publish something that I wrote. It was the Last Hao Gao – a 300 micro-story for Birmingham Words online. It was such a big deal to me that someone out there liked something I wrote. Many thanks for that huge boost!\nAs a British Chinese writer, you’ve talked about how growing up, very few books you had access to featured Chinese people, or reflected your own experience. What effect did this have on you as a reader, a future writer, and a human being? I grew up loving detective fiction, such as Agatha Christie. At secondary school and at University I sought out more books by authors of colour and read a lot of African American books. When I lived in the U.S for a year I wanted to find more books that were by Asian American authors. It’s been a progression from reading no books with British Chinese content to being a creator of those stories.\nMy BA and MPhil were focussed on Asian American literature and film and I wrote about The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan and the film version by Wayne Wang. I remember reading The Joy Luck Club for the first time and crying because it was an East Asian diaspora woman in charge of the narrative.\nThe lack of role models and representation has fuelled my desire to see more literature and characters on screen who are BESEA (British East and Southeast Asian). I thought about becoming an academic but changed my mind. Instead, I wanted to focus on creating literature to fill the massive void that I felt there was. I wanted to write about people like me and people I knew who were second-generation British Chinese. I felt that my best chance of changing things was to write and to help others to do the same.\nBeing a published author is not easy, you have to learn the craft, and you have to navigate an industry where you are in a minority. I had some personal setbacks and took time off to have children, but I knew it was my calling to do this work as a creator. In the end, I want to be the one who is telling the story. If we can tell our own stories, then we can at least recognise some of ourselves in literature and film.\nDanny Chung explores the experience of growing up while traversing cultures and struggling with cultural stereotypes. How much of you is there in your character of Danny Chung? I didn’t think there was much of me in Danny when I was writing him. As he’s quite cheeky and does things behind his parents’ backs, which I never did. I grew up with white parents and looked Chinese, so there was that aspect of always being between two cultures. I didn’t think I was Danny, however, looking back, I was into drawing, and I did want to be more like the ‘cool’ girls groups in school. I think that wanting to belong is a trope for all children, not just Danny or children from diverse backgrounds. Children want to do what they want to do, but parents will have differing ideas sometimes – it’s universal.\nI did base Nai Nai on a few older women in my life. My friend’s grandmother who arrived from China, my own Chinese grandmother who I met later in my life, my mum Jean, and my mother-in-law who I like to say ‘over loves’ my children. She overfeeds them to show them her love because they don’t share a language.\nI wanted to write a fun story which featured family and friends. I wasn’t setting out to mine my life or write an autobiographical novel which I feel is a trend in #ownvoices now. Publishers want writers to have those experiences for authenticity. I think we can write fiction which contains ‘a truth’ and authenticity, but that doesn’t have to be autobiographical.\nVisit Maisie Chan’s website.\nThe stories we tell matter for how we imagine ourselves, each other and the society we live in. To what extent did you get into writing to challenge the narrowness of these stories? And how do you think storytelling can bring about change? Stories matter. If we only hear stories that Chinese people are a threat, then people might believe those stories and more insidiously, as a community, we might believe those falsehoods ourselves. I’ve met Chinese people who have told me they hate Chinese people. We believe there is one kind of Chinese person, there isn’t. We’re multitudinous and not homogenous. That’s why it’s important to have a term like BESEA because many people living in the UK aren’t Chinese but get racialised as ‘Chinese’.\nWe’ve seen it in the past decade used in politics: the vilification of large groups of people works in all kinds of ways to maintain power, and it feeds into these fears.\nMy move into children’s fiction came about in 2016 when I got on to the Megaphone writer development scheme. The scheme supported five BAME writers and their development. It also came about during the Brexit campaign. Brexit affected me deeply—half of my family is Spanish. We moved to Scotland as a result. The vilification of immigrants also affects me, my biological parents came from another country. I am part of an immigration legacy.\nI absolutely got into writing to counter those narratives. I also am a damn-good storyteller. I’ve learnt that I can write for ALL age groups. This is not because I am some kind of magician, it’s because I have spent a lot of my time being around different kinds of humans and I have spent nearly fifteen years trying to be a better writer. If you travel and are lucky enough to live in different countries, it opens up your mind and heart to people who are like you and who aren’t like you. I still have to work through my own prejudices and through my stories I intend to create narratives where the majority of the characters are not white. I try to have nuance, and if I do have a character who is slightly stereotypical, I want them to have dimensions. The balance is trying to write cultural commonalities without falling into negative stereotypes. At the end of the day, I am simply writing about humans who have experienced life through a certain lens.\nYou have said that when it comes to cultural and identity politics in relation to people of British East and Southeast Asian (BESEA) heritage, the UK is far behind the USA, and is still particularly entrenched in a kind of orientalist world-view. How can this be dismantled? We still have supermarkets and small businesses using the word ‘oriental.’ If that is what the dominant society has called you for decades (and if you aren’t up on critical race theory) you wouldn’t know its negative connotations. I have books from the 90s on this subject that are from Asian American studies and very little research has been done on how BESEA characters are portrayed in British children’s literature. Dr Sarah Park Dahlen is one of the leading scholars on this area in the States. To my knowledge we don’t have a person like that in the UK.\nI urge people to not use the word ‘oriental.’ It is a dated construct. Edward Said has written a whole book about it as has Robert G Lee. The opposite is ‘Occidental’ but nobody goes around saying ‘Oh I think I’ll have this Occidental fish in batter tonight.’ The word ‘others’ people who are BESEA and makes them sound exotic. The result is that people that look like me are seen as not ‘like you’. The acronym BESEA is quite new. I only heard it in 2020. And it emerged when lots of younger people from East and Southeast Asian backgrounds decided to use it on social media. I myself had struggled to find a phrase that I could use to describe people from East and Southeast Asian countries that could be shortened.\nTo begin to dismantle this world-view we need a working vocabulary to replace our outdated vocabulary. That is why BESEA is useful at the moment. It provides a pan-ethnic alliance, although it misses out Pacific Islanders (in the States, they use Asian American Pacific Islanders). We need not only to avoid using those words that hurt us. We also need to educate others not to use ‘oriental’, and similar language.\nI also love the idea that Marcus Ryder and Lenny Henry talked of when they said actually ‘diversity’ is not in a minority. Most people in the UK represent some aspect of this diversity. They may be disabled or have a chronic illness. They might be LGBTQIA+. They might be from an ethnic background. And the world majority is actually people of colour. If businesses thought outside the box, they would see that the market is global. We can see that with streaming media companies – stories are now global. People all over the world enjoy Korean soap operas and music, for example. So we’re engaging with content from all over the world, and by diversifying your workforce and who your authors are, you open up literature to the world.\nWe already have BEATS (British East Asian in Theatre and Screen) who have been doing important work by calling out racist depictions in TV, Film and Theatre. They also have schemes to increase BESEA representation behind the camera as well as in front of it. And social media platform BESEA.N and a host of other newly formed organisations are starting to create awareness.\nThere has been a massive rise in hate crimes against anyone who looks Chinese (even though they might not be Chinese) because of Covid-19. This has helped to create some community cohesion and action. Hopefully, it will also help to open up conversations of anti-blackness and vilification of Muslims within the BESEA community too.\nIt has to start with people caring. If your own community doesn’t care, then who will?\nAll writing is political to the extent it proposes a particular vision of what our collective existence could be. So if you imagine a young reader settling down with one of your books, as well as wanting them to have fun reading, how do you want the experience to affect them? I agree. Writing is a political act, and the content informs our collective thoughts on what it is to be a human.\nI want children from all races to connect with my characters because the experience of being a human is universal. Children’s literature can be a vehicle for empathy and understanding at an early age. For those readers who are BESEA, I want them to recognise themselves either in the illustrations, the descriptions or simply in the little things—like taking your shoes off when you come into the house. But I also want them to see their existence reflected in the book, and to think, “I’m important enough to be a central character.”\nMost importantly though, I want to tell an engaging story for a child to read. I like to include things that someone the age of my character would encounter at school or at home. And I enjoy writing layered stories that work on various levels.\nAs well as being a writer, you are a mentor for other writers through the Megaphone project, which works with writers of colour in the earlier stages of their careers. Can you say more about the project, and why it is so important?\nI’m mentoring two writers on Megaphone 2021/22. I had one place reserved for a BESEA writer because I felt there was a significant lack of published children’s authors from BESEA backgrounds in the UK. I chose Ten The Gioi as I want to read her novel about a Hanoi detective. I think having a British Vietnamese author also helps dispel the myth that everyone is British Chinese.\nAnd my other mentee, Nazima Pathan, I chose purely on the writing sample and novel idea. I want to see a South Asian Artemis Fowl-like book.\nLeila Rasheed was one of the first people to begin mentoring schemes for writers of colour who wanted to be published children’s authors. She took it upon herself to get Arts Council funding and industry support for the first cohort which included myself, Danielle Jawando, Nafisa Mutadhi, Avanti Taneja and Joyce Effia-Harmer. Leila recognised that short workshops or panel talks about increasing diversity often don’t lead to very much. You have to think long-term and having a year long mentoring scheme is invaluable.\nWhen I was on the scheme, we had many masterclasses with authors such as Alex Wheatle, Patrice Lawrence, Catherine Johnson and Candy Gourlay to name a few. We also had editors and other industry professionals come and speak to us. What I gained most was sustained support and confidence.\nThis time around Stephanie King from Usborne is volunteering her time to start a community strand of the scheme. This will be for those who didn’t make the final six as mentees and will mean they’ll still have support and access to resources.\nMegaphone is important because it’s a grassroots project so there is heart already infused into it. It’s not some tick box initiative.\nFinally, we want you to share a few of the things you love. As well as Danny Chung and Tiger Warrior, if you could send us away to read any three books, what would they be? I loved The Leavers by Lisa Ko which is about a boy who is separated from his mother. Some of it is written from her perspective later on, and it has themes of immigration and diaspora lives.\nNoughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman was one of the first YA books that I read. It showed me that you can make a big impact in the lives of young people through literature. It’s a British YA classic.\nThe Vegetarian by Hang Kang. I quite like odd surreal reads too, and this was a book that played with expectations. I enjoyed its quirkiness.\n",

            "content": "Info Project date: June 2020 Project location: Sofia, Bulgaria Project partners: Goethe Institut, Bulgaria; Caritas, Bulgaria Overview For World Refugee Day in 2020, we ran a day of writing workshops in collaboration with the Goethe Institut, Bulgaria, and Caritas.\nDuring the workshop, participants shared stories in multiple languages: English, Bulgarian, Kurdish and Arabic. We were aided by Sophia, Caritas\u0026rsquo;s brilliant translator.\nProject Outcomes What we loved about the stories the participants told was how varied they were, how in a few brief hours we mapped out the vastness of human experience: we had funny stories and sad stories, everyday stories and stories about extraordinary events.\nHere are three extracts. All these stories were first written in Arabic. They were translated into Bulgarian, and we’ve made versions in English to give a flavour of the workshop.\nOne day it rained heavily and hard. I usually like to look out the window when it’s bathed in the rain, but it was raining so hard, I couldn’t see anything. The rain drops ran down the glass, flowing along with the dust, and I decided the windows needed washing. I looked all over the house for the towel I use to clean the windows, but I couldn’t find it….\nHere’s the beginning of another piece that was hugely moving.\nWhen the war started, like many others, I had to decide whether to leave. I am glad I made this decision: if I hadn’t done what I felt was right, I wouldn’t be the person I am now. Now I can look after my children, raise them and give them education and opportunities. When a decision is made, you must follow it, regardless of the difficulties in the path ahead…\nAnd finally, there was a tale of an apparently dying father pressing his son to marry. Here’s how the story started.\nI was around eighteen years old. The story I’m about to tell you is actually very funny. One day while I was in military school, my dad called me and told me he was very sick. This rocked me hard internally. He asked me to go see him. I went straight away, and he said to me: “Look, I’m not feeling well, I don’t know how much longer I have to live. But please, for my sake, so my heart can be calm, I want you to marry…”\nAnd, at the risk of giving spoilers, several decades after this story took place, both father and son are still alive and well.\nStories and friendship We ended the workshop by talking about stories and friendship, and how exchanging stories helps us make deeper, more human connections. Through telling and hearing stories, we can find points of connection with those whose experiences differ from our own. And, to use a phrase we love from the scholar Wendy Doniger, we can skim closer to the ground of the human heart.\nImages: © Goethe-Institut/Ilian Ruzhen\n",

We wanted a course that put ethics at the very heart of things. Project Outcomes We wrote the bulk of the course between 2018 and 2019.

So we gave a talk, telling the story of Wind\u0026amp;Bones up to that point.\nIntro [Hannah] Hello!\nWe’re delighted to be here at EmpathEAST 2019, and excited to be working together over the next few days.\nIt’s also great to be in the lovely city of Plovdiv and to be getting a sense of the history, the cultural richness and the energy of 2019’s European Capital of Culture.\nWe are Dr. Hannah Stevens and Dr. Will Buckingham. We’re both writers from the UK, and we are working together on a project called Wind And Bones. We’re interested in the meeting places between writing, social justice and creativity.\nToday we’re going to talk about stories. The stories we tell about ourselves and about each other. The stories we tell about the world. And the stories we tell about the future. We’re also going to tell the story of our own work with Wind and Bones, why we set up the project, and why we are so very excited to be here with all of you, trying to imagine new and better futures.\nWe are made of stories [Will] Say it. Say it.\nThe universe is made of stories,\nnot of atoms.\nA universe made of stories, not of atoms? The line comes from Muriel Rukeyser’s 1968 poem, ‘The Speed of Darkness’. Ever since we read the poem, we have been enchanted by this idea.\nWhat universe is Rukeyser talking about? Not the universe of things, the universe that physicists try to describe. But a universe that is equally deep, just as complex and as subtle: the universe of experience. It is the universe of our loves and hates, our passions and dreams, our fears and anxieties. This universe is the universe that is made of stories.\nWe cannot imagine ourselves, imagine each other, or imagine our society without telling and retelling stories. Stories are what our experience is made of. Not just as individuals, but also as collectives.\nTogether we weave stories about class and gender, culture and sexuality, nations and religions, goodness and badness, what matters and what doesn’t matter. These stories shape our lives, they shape our societies, and they shape our future on this planet that we share.\nSo it matters what stories we tell. Say it. Say it. The universe is made of stories.\nThe Trouble With Stories [Hannah] This is why we need to pay more attention to the stories we tell. It is why we need to develop a deeper understanding of how stories work, and how they shape our lives. It is why we need to be bolder, more courageous, in finding new stories.\nStories are powerful. They can be a force for positive change. But they can also be divisive and destructive. Stories that are told to denigrate and exclude others. To take one example: in much of Europe, storytellers in the media and in power tell tales about the harms of immigration, about how our cultures are at risk from people who come from far off, looking for new lives, or security, or freedom from conflict. Or, to take another example, stories about the nature of men and the nature of women that lock both men and women into a culture that diminishes us all, excluding women from positions of power, limiting the possibilities of human life. And although stories such as these are poorly supported by the evidence, they have the potential to shape and reshape our cultures.\nSo it matters what stories that we tell. And it matters that we break the hold destructive myths have upon our collective imagination. We need to tell new stories. The responsibility is on us. As Rukeyser asks, at the end of The Speed of Darkness, ‘Who will speak these days / if not I / if not you?’\nTelling new stories [Will] So we’re going to tell the story of our own work, our small contribution to this big task of imagining and reimagining our world through fashioning new stories.\nMy own background is in philosophy and anthropology. Over a decade ago, I wrote a PhD thesis on the relationship between stories and ethics. At the time, I was running lots of grassroots writing and philosophy projects. I was interested in bringing philosophy back down to earth, in everyday ethics and everyday stories, and how stories allow us to navigate through the world, even if we cannot agree on questions about right and wrong.\nThere’s an idea from the mythological traditions of India that stories are like the sea. Meanwhile, the philosopher Aristotle talks about ethics as being like navigation. I wanted to bring these two thoughts together, to explore how we can navigate the sea of stories better.\nAfter my PhD, I taught writing for several years in a university. I wrote books: novels, philosophy books, children’s books about sea voyages. But I was never fully at home in the university. I always believed in a broader social vision for both philosophy and writing. And so, in early 2016, I quit, so that I could better realise this vision.\nTelling new stories [Hannah] My own background is in creative writing. I have always believed in the importance of writing as a way of bringing to light forgotten, overlooked,\nhidden, ignored and suppressed voices. As a writer, I work in short stories and non fiction. Alongside my love of stories and storytelling, for most of my working life, I have been engaged in social justice issues. I worked for a charity that helped community groups find funding for social projects. And this work showed me the power of community-based, grassroots organisations. I was also actively engaged in working with LGBTQI communities, and in the field of sexual health.\nThis hunger for hidden and marginalised stories led to a PhD in creative writing. For my PhD research, I worked on a project exploring missing people. I researched real life stories of people in the UK and Ireland who had gone missing. I worked with the police and charities to understand better the complex reasons that people go missing. And then I wrote a collection of short stories that testify to these interrupted lives. So after completing my PhD, I wanted to draw together my interests in writing, and in finding ways to make space for stories that are excluded or forgotten.\nTelling new stories: Wind\u0026amp;Bones (Will) This is how, back at the beginning of 2018, Hannah and I put our heads together, to see if we could combine our skills and make something new. And so we took a risk and founded Wind\u0026amp;Bones. With Hannah’s long experience of grassroots groups, her activism and advocacy, and with my experience of education, we saw exciting possibilities for telling new stories about writing, creativity and social justice.\nWe took our name from the sixth century Chinese writer Liu Xie. In his book on the art of writing, Liu says, ‘Cultivate the vigour of the wind, and make the bone robust.’ In other words, make sure there is vitality, the pulse of energy, the winds of change; but pay attention to structure, to mechanics, to how things work. Be idealistic but practical. It is good advice for writing. For activism. For social change. And for life.\nWind\u0026amp;Bones was an experiment. We started by running workshops in the UK with refugee writers, helping them to tell their stories. We came to Bulgaria, on short residency at the Literature and Translation House in Sofia. And then we were offered two more opportunities: to run a workshop on ethics at the Ubud Writers’ festival in Indonesia, and an eight month residency at a graduate institute in Yangon, Myanmar.\nMyanmar [Hannah] So we took the plunge. I left my job. We packed up our homes. We found foster homes for Will’s cat Bod, and my house-rabbit Agatha. We flew to Indonesia. We ran our workshop. We connected with fellow writers and activists. Then we went on to Yangon where we ran writing courses working with journalists, writers, activists and former political prisoners. Military rule in Myanmar ended only in 2011, and the country was changing fast. It was still a troubled place. Everybody knows about the oppression of the Rohingya. But not so many people outside Myanmar know about the huge problems with ethnic conflicts throughout the country, and the issues of social justice and inequality. Myanmar was a world that in transition, one where large changes were taking place. And we realised how powerfully it was being shaped by stories and storytelling. Over eight months, we taught classes, we worked with social activist organisations, we trained teachers, and we developed educational resources with local grassroots groups.\nIn all of our work in Myanmar, we worked alongside local organisations to help find ways of opening up spaces for more diverse storytelling, to help those wanted to tell their stories more vividly.\nGreece and Bulgaria [Will] In June, our residency in Yangon came to an end, and we relocated to Greece. We wanted to continue to develop our work with refugee and migrant communities. And we had our own writing projects to pursue. Hannah was finishing her first book-length story collection, and I wanted to research my forthcoming book, Hello Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World. In particular, I was fascinated by stories about how, back in 2015 and 2016, ordinary Greek people opened their homes to migrants and refugees from Syria.\nWe continued to run workshops. We worked in Volvi refugee camp, on a project supported by an organisation called Refugee Trauma Initiative. We worked with young migrants, many of them from Afghanistan, exploring the stories that matter most to them, the stories the media does not tell. But we also made connections regionally, in particular with friends and colleagues in Bulgaria, and with the wonderful Ideas Factory. Now we’re based in Sofia for some months — we arrived on Wednesday — teaching classes in partnership with Sofia university, and further developing with refugees and other marginalised communities.\nWhat we have learned so far? [Hannah] We are in the middle of this story, not at the end. But what have we learned so far? The first thing, the most important thing, we have learned is this: stories matter. They matter more than we think, more than we believe, perhaps more than we can imagine. We’ve heard so many stories over the past few years. And we have helped many storytellers tell their stories better. It is a privilege to witness somebody else’s story. It is an insight into a different way of being human. These stories have enlarged our world, have given us a sense of new possibilities. We have learned that everybody has a story to tell, and that if you make space for them to do so, if you have the patience to listen to people’st stories, then they come alive. Discovering and owning your stories, telling and retelling them, finding ways of communicating better — these things all lead to deeper connections. They enrich our collective lives. And they open up paths to new creative action. What else have we learned? We have learned that when you open yourself up to new stories, your own story changes. The Italian writer Roberto Calasso says ‘stories do not live alone.’ But neither do we. Through telling stories, we shape and reshape ourselves and our relationships, and find ourselves on unexpected trajectories.\nIn Conclusion So that is the story so far. At the end of this, we believe more strongly than ever that the world is made of stories. And that if we care about the future, as we all do, we need to tell better stories, and we need to tell them better.\nThank you so much for listening. Feel free to ask us anything about our work over the next few days at this forum. And we’re always up for new collaborations, new projects, new and interesting stories. But for now, this is our story so far. Thank you again, and we look forward to hearing yours.\n",

We decided when we set up the workshops that we wanted them to be about writing and storytelling, rather than English-language classes. So we made the decision that we would encourage writers to write in whatever language they felt comfortable.\nIt was our first time experimenting with multilingual creative writing workshops. And it was a delight to hear stories in Swahili, Arabic, Persian, Hindi, English, French and many more languages.\nWhen it came to sharing, we asked participants to introduce their stories with a sentence or two in English, so that listeners could understand the context. Then we asked them to read in whatever language the story was written in.\nProject Outcomes This was our first ever project working as Wind\u0026amp;Bones, and it gave us a chance to develop and hone our approach to multilingual writing workshops.\n",

The collection was based on Hannah’s PhD research at the University of Leicester. The stories testify to the complexity and diversity of the reasons that lead to people going missing. In their Absence has been translated into Bulgarian.\nHannah has led projects for organisations including the BBC, the British Embassy, and Greenpeace.\nWill has a PhD in philosophy and an MA in anthropology. His most recent book is Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World (Granta 2021/2). Hello, Stranger was a BBC Radio4 Book of the Week.
