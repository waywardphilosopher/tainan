      <description>Last month, we kicked off our latest project, a philosophy salon in collaboration with the wonderful people at the Wansha Performing Arts Centre / 涴莎藝術展演中心 here in Tainan. The salon is a chance for members of the public to come together and talk about the relationship between philosophy and the paradoxes and puzzles of everyday life.&#xA;We are incredibly excited by this project, in particular because it is our first Chinese-language-only project.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re delighted that Looking for Wisdom, the philosophy-by-email project run by Dr Will Buckingham, is now a part of Wind&amp;amp;Bones. At Wind&amp;amp;Bones, we believe that creative writing and creative thinking have the power to change the world. So this new collaboration is a great fit for what we do.&#xA;Looking for Wisdom brings the world&amp;rsquo;s philosophy to your inbox with free weekly Philosopher Files. The project was launched formally on January 1st this year.</description>
