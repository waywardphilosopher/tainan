      <description>Last week, we were at the British Ambassador&amp;rsquo;s Residence in Sofia for a fundraising event with the Emprove Foundation for our Awakening Between the Lines Project. Here&amp;rsquo;s the speech we wrote for the event.&#xA;Good evening. I&amp;rsquo;m Will Buckingham, co-director of Wind&amp;amp;Bones, and over there is my colleague and Wind&amp;amp;Bones co-director Hannah Stevens. Wind&amp;amp;Bones is a social enterprise now based in Scotland, and we run projects at the intersection of writing, creativity and social change.</description>
