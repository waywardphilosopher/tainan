      <description>Earlier this week, Wind&amp;amp;Bones were in the wonderfully laid-back city of Taitung, where we were invited to give a talk at 國立臺東大學 National Taitung University on social entrepreneurship. It was also the first time we have talked publicly about our work in Chinese, which was very exciting (and not a little nerve-wracking).&#xA;During the lecture, we discussed our work at Wind&amp;amp;Bones, and how we use writing and storytelling to bring about positive social change.</description>

      <description>We were invited to EmpathEAST in Plovdiv in 2019 to talk about our work at Wind&amp;amp;Bones. So we gave a talk, telling the story of Wind&amp;amp;Bones up to that point.&#xA;Intro [Hannah] Hello!&#xA;We’re delighted to be here at EmpathEAST 2019, and excited to be working together over the next few days.&#xA;It’s also great to be in the lovely city of Plovdiv and to be getting a sense of the history, the cultural richness and the energy of 2019’s European Capital of Culture.</description>
