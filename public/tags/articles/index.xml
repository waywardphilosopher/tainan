      <description>When we set up Wind&amp;amp;Bones back in 2018, we wanted a name that reflected our vision of writing, creativity and social change. And after a lot of discussion, eventually we came up with Wind&amp;amp;Bones.&#xA;But what&amp;rsquo;s in a name? And why are we called this? Is one of us &amp;ldquo;Wind&amp;rdquo; and one of us &amp;ldquo;Bones&amp;rdquo;? Are these our secret superhero names? Alas, no! But the real story is fun and interesting too, and it goes back to medieval China.</description>

      <description>At Wind&amp;amp;Bones, one myth we’re keen to dispel is the myth of the suffering artist. One of the things we do when working with writers is help them find ways to seek out delight and pleasure in their writing. Because once you have pleasure and delight, you have energy and life, and when you have energy and life, you are already half-way to creating something worthwhile.&#xA;Of course, writing can be difficult (tell us about it).</description>
