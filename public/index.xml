      <description>Next week, we&amp;rsquo;ll be running a workshop for lecturers at Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology called Finding and Communicating your Inspiration. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be working with members of academic staff across the university, exploring how storytelling can be used to more effectively communciate academic research. We&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a lot of academics in the past, both in groups and also through one-on-one mentoring. And one of the things we&amp;rsquo;re particularly proud of is how some of the projects that we&amp;rsquo;ve worked on have led to published, and critically-acclaimed, books.</description>

      <description>Last month, we kicked off our latest project, a philosophy salon in collaboration with the wonderful people at the Wansha Performing Arts Centre / 涴莎藝術展演中心 here in Tainan. The salon is a chance for members of the public to come together and talk about the relationship between philosophy and the paradoxes and puzzles of everyday life.&#xA;We are incredibly excited by this project, in particular because it is our first Chinese-language-only project.</description>

      <description>We ended 2023 with a ten-day residency at the Nanning Literary House (南寧文學·家), where we ran a project called 滋養台南 | Nourishing Tainan. We spent ten days working on our writing, and also working with members of the public to write stories about the things that nourish us: the food that nourishes our bodies, the stories that nourish our spirit, and the ideas that nourish our imagination.

      <description>Earlier this week, Wind&amp;amp;Bones were in the wonderfully laid-back city of Taitung, where we were invited to give a talk at 國立臺東大學 National Taitung University on social entrepreneurship. It was also the first time we have talked publicly about our work in Chinese, which was very exciting (and not a little nerve-wracking).&#xA;During the lecture, we discussed our work at Wind&amp;amp;Bones, and how we use writing and storytelling to bring about positive social change.</description>

      <description>How can stories, books, museums, and other parts of our shared culture bring about social change? We think about these things a lot, so it&amp;rsquo;s been a delight to be visiting the seaside city of Busan in Korea, where we were at the World Humanities Forum, talking about Humanities in Relationship: Towards Communication, Coexistence and Empathy.&#xA;Wind&amp;amp;Bones&amp;rsquo;s Dr Will Buckingham was presenting a paper at the forum on how the idea of philoxenia — a term coming from Greek meaning &amp;ldquo;friendship with that which is other&amp;rdquo; — can help us think through the significance of museums for their visitors.</description>

      <description>Seven years ago we ran our first storytelling workshop as Wind&amp;amp;Bones. This first ever workshop was a multilingual event with asylum-seekers and refugees in Leicester, UK. It was a sheer, boisterous delight, held in a community hall in the centre of the city. We shared and wrote stories in multiple languages, whilst at the same time an exercise class was taking part in another corner of the hall, and lunch being served in yet another.</description>

      <description>If you have been following our work for a while, you will know that at Wind&amp;amp;Bones, we have long-standing connections with Myanmar. In 2017, Wind&amp;amp;Bones&amp;rsquo;s Will Buckingham was on the founding faculty at the Parami Institute, which is now Parami University. Then between 2018 and 2019, Will was back in Myanmar to work on a writing residency with his Wind&amp;amp;Bones collaborator and co-director, Hannah Stevens, delivering workshops on writing, ethics and social change.</description>

      <description>This July 2023, we worked in Dundee, Scotland with a group of young people, exploring the art of manifesto-writing, and asking how telling truer, better stories can help to counter false perceptions of young people and their lives.&#xA;We explored manifestos from the last one hundred and fifty years, and then collectively wrote a manifesto of our own, one that aimed to get to the heart of the complex, multi-faceted experience of what it means to be a young person today.</description>

      <description>Last summer, we worked with GIY (Ireland), Ashoka, and the wonderful Dr. Sarah Prosser on a project to develop a manifesto for future food in the Waterford Bioregion. We co-ran a workshop with local farmers, community members and consumers, leading to the drafting of a manifesto for rethinking the centrality of food in all of our lives.&#xA;You can read more about the project here: Waterford Manifesto.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re delighted that the manifesto is now available on YouTube, read by Ray McGrath, who took part in the workshop.</description>

      <description>This August, we&amp;rsquo;ll be packing our bags, and heading over to Taiwan. We were last in Taiwan four years ago, on a short visit from Myanmar, and we found ourselves smitten. In particular, while in Tainan (our favourite Taiwanese city), we visited the National Museum of Taiwan Literature, and we were enormously impressed by the nuanced and thoughtful take on the ways in which literature can act as a driver of positive social change.</description>

We talked about three chapters from Liu&amp;rsquo;s book, exploring the text&amp;rsquo;s philosophical underpinnings, insights into the craft of writing, and discussion of the writer&amp;rsquo;s life.</description>

The interview below is very lightly edited. Happy reading!&#xA;On creativity Tim Hello, Will and Hannah.</description>

Premise is a community &amp;ldquo;where the curious come to connect, learn, and grapple with life’s enduring questions.&amp;rdquo; Premise is neither a book club nor a college-style course. Instead, it is a chance to explore wide-ranging questions about human life, based on the shared experience of reading.</description>

While here in Funchal, we&amp;rsquo;re looking over what we have done in 2022 and making plans for 2023.&#xA;2022 in Review Wind&amp;amp;Bones move to Scotland Last year was incredibly busy. The most significant change was that we moved from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Dundee, Scotland. After almost 2½ years working in Bulgaria, we felt like we needed to reconnect to our UK roots, so we moved up to Scotland.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, we spent three days in an unexpectedly sunny Glasgow at the Dandelion Festival, a part of the UK-wide Unboxed Festival.&#xA;Dandelion is about deepening our relationship with the natural world, about the joy of growing, and about thinking more deeply about where our food comes from.&#xA;So over the course of the weekend, we were in a potting shed — a little wooden hut — asking people to share their own stories about food: the food they love, the food they hate, the food they like to cook, the food that has caused them to fall in and out of love, the food that reminds them of home.</description>

      <description>Today, we&amp;rsquo;ve been celebrating the fact that Wind&amp;amp;Bones is now a thoroughly Scottish social enterprise. As we are here in Dundee for the long term, we decided to move our business from England to Scotland. This is easier said than done, as companies cannot be straightforwardly moved over the border. But with the help of the brilliant people at Senscot Legal, we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to work round the problem.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ve changed the name of our old CIC to Wind&amp;amp;Bones (England), and we&amp;rsquo;ve set up a new CIC called simply Wind&amp;amp;Bones, registered in Scotland.</description>

We landed here a week ago, and since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve been busy unpacking boxes and getting settled. It&amp;rsquo;s great to be up in Scotland. We&amp;rsquo;ve only been here a few days. But already, Dundee has been hugely welcoming. It has been great to start making connections and getting to know the local writing scene.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a few new projects recently, including a collaboration with Parami University in Myanmar. We were writers in residence at Parami back in 2018-2019, and after the military coup of February 1st this year, we&amp;rsquo;ve been deeply preoccupied with the unfolding situation over there. So we&amp;rsquo;re delighted to be working with Parami University again, running some remote courses via Zoom for students across Myanmar.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re running three courses in all.</description>

      <title>Why Wind&amp;Bones?</title>

      <guid>https://www.windandbones.com/posts/why-wind-and-bones/</guid>
      <description>When we set up Wind&amp;amp;Bones back in 2018, we wanted a name that reflected our vision of writing, creativity and social change. And after a lot of discussion, eventually we came up with Wind&amp;amp;Bones.&#xA;But what&amp;rsquo;s in a name? And why are we called this? Is one of us &amp;ldquo;Wind&amp;rdquo; and one of us &amp;ldquo;Bones&amp;rdquo;? Are these our secret superhero names? Alas, no! But the real story is fun and interesting too, and it goes back to medieval China.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re delighted that our very own Will Buckingham&amp;rsquo;s Hello, Stranger: How We Find Connection in a Disconnected World is coming out from Granta this July 1st.&#xA;Will&amp;rsquo;s book brings together insights from philosophy, anthropology, history, and literature to explore how our traditions of meeting with strangers can mitigate the issues of our time. Taking in stories of loneliness, exile, and friendship from classical times to the modern day, and alighting in adapting communities from Birmingham to Myanmar, Hello, Stranger asks: how do we set aside our instinctive xenophobia – fear of outsiders – and embrace our equally natural philoxenia – love of strangers and newness?</description>

      <description>The other week, we had the pleasure of sitting down for a long Zoom chat about creativity with scholar, travel-writer and researcher Dr Tim Hannigan. Tim works for Dublin City University on their DCU CREDNE — Forging Creativity project.&#xA;We were talking about the connections between creativity and interdisciplinarity, why we want university creative writing to decamp from English departments to the art school, and the creative benefits of operating at the margins of formal academia.</description>

      <title>Writing, Pleasure &amp; the Myth of the Suffering Artist</title>
      <link>https://www.windandbones.com/posts/writing-and-pleasure/</link>

      <description>At Wind&amp;amp;Bones, one myth we’re keen to dispel is the myth of the suffering artist. One of the things we do when working with writers is help them find ways to seek out delight and pleasure in their writing. Because once you have pleasure and delight, you have energy and life, and when you have energy and life, you are already half-way to creating something worthwhile.&#xA;Of course, writing can be difficult (tell us about it).</description>
