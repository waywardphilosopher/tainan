      <description>One of my most cherished meals is pork blood cake in ginger duck hot pot. The rich flavors of the cake blend perfectly with the fragrant sesame oil-infused broth. Despite Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s lack of distinct winters, I love sharing this dish with my family, creating treasured memories.&#xA;Image: From A Natural History of Ducks (1922).

      <description>Info Project date: 2024 Project location: Tainan, Taiwan Project partners: Wansha Performing Arts Centre / 涴莎藝術展演中心 Overview From January 2024 to November 2024, we&amp;rsquo;re running a public philosophy salon at the Wansha Performing Arts Centre in Tainan. The salon meets on the third Saturday of every month, to ask how philosophy can throw light on the puzzles and paradoxes of everyday life.&#xA;The salon is run entirely in Mandarin (which is a fun challenge for us), and is free for the public to attend.</description>

      <description>Two days before Christmas, we wrapped up our project with a final lecture generously hosted by the StableNice Café here in Tainan. We drank tea, ate cake, talked about our work at Wind&amp;amp;Bones, shared some of the stories from the project, and talked about what we had learned over the ten days of our residency.&#xA;We also spent some time encouraging guests to get involved by sharing stories of their own.</description>

      <description>When it comes to eating something special, I think of nothing but pork braised rice. Why? Because my mum is really good at cooking it.&#xA;Pork braised rice always brings me warm and happy memories. The colour, the smell, the taste — it always arouses my appetite.&#xA;Wherever I am, I cannot forget pork braised rice.&#xA;— William Liu Image: Office of the President, Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic.

      <description>一股連我也不知道是什麼的滋味，從裡向外展開 我會注意到那攤子，是因為所有人似乎都急切的想要無視它。賣仙草茶的老人衝著行人笑，笑的有點不知所措。&#xA;我拉著媽直直走向攤子。「一杯！」&#xA;老人怔了怔才把茶給我。過時的東西賣久了，連他也差點無視了自己的存在。我喝了一口沒人要的茶。苦！&#xA;「好喝嗎？」我媽遲疑地問。&#xA;「我們買一瓶回家！」老人笑開了花。&#xA;我又喝了一口。&#xA;— Kelly&#xA;A flavour even I don&amp;rsquo;t know A flavour — even I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is — unfolds from the inside outwards.&#xA;The reason I noticed the stall was because everyone else seemed eager to ignore it. The old man selling grass jelly tea smiled at passersby. His smile seemed a little awkward.&#xA;I pulled my mum straight towards the stall. &amp;ldquo;Just one cup!</description>

      <description>It was my father who taught me to cook. In my family he prepared meals for all of us — breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is very different from a traditional Asian family.&#xA;The reason my father started to cook was because he wanted to reproduce the dishes made by his father, our grandpa. My father&amp;rsquo;s father passed away in my father&amp;rsquo;s early childhood. I never knew him.&#xA;Since learning why my father cooked, I have asked him to teach me some basic cooking skills.</description>

      <description>After arriving in Tokyo a year ago, my cooking skills have noticeably improved. Since being here I&amp;rsquo;ve grown accustomed to the high prices of fruits and gradually accepted the limited variety of vegetables. These new restraints have meant I’ve grown in creativity in the kitchen.&#xA;The excellent quality of beef here is impressive though finding a whole beef shank can be quite difficult. Even when cooking for family, Japanese people seldom buy such large cuts of meat in one go.</description>

      <description>My grandmother once told me that in her childhood she thought that Taiwanese kimchi was the most delicious food. When I was a child, she told me a bedside story about her early life. She told me how, in the early days of Taiwan, families with farming backgrounds faced financial struggles. They relied on thin porridge with a few small, pickled dried fish, or soy sauce. They rarely had the opportunity to enjoy dishes with meat or vegetables.</description>

      <description>The tomato is a strange thing, because some call it a vegetable and some think it is a fruit. But to me, whether fruit or vegetable, above all else it is a memory of my childhood.&#xA;When I was small I used to go to the farm near my home to help harvest tomatoes. When we finished the work we each took a tomato and we squeezed it between our palms as a way of cleaning our hands.</description>

      <description>不想破壞驚喜 如果你來到台南， 我非常建議你來富農街、裕農路尋找美食。 在這後甲圓環一帶充滿各式小吃： 火雞肉飯、臭豆腐、鱔魚意麵 ⋯⋯&#xA;我不能再更多了， 這會破壞驚喜。&#xA;— 張芳瑋&#xA;&amp;ndash;&#xA;Not Wanting to Spoil the Surprise If you come to Taiwan, I really recommend you go to Funong Street and Yunong Road, in search of good things to eat. The area by the Houjia roundabout is full of different kinds of snacks: turkey rice, stinky tofu, eel noodles&amp;hellip;&#xA;I can&amp;rsquo;t add any more — it will spoil the surprise.</description>

      <description>蘿蔔 蘿蔔是台式食物的基本班底。 是低調溫潤的和聲。蘿蔔糕、蘿蔔絲餅、蘿蔔飯、雞湯、蔬菜湯、醃蘿蔔， 可以柔軟也能爽脆。大概是最台南的食材之一，無處不在。&#xA;– 魚果&#xA;Radish Radish is the fundamental ingredient of Taiwanese food. It is a subdued and gentle harmony. Radish cake, grated radish patties, radish rice, chicken soup, vegetable soup, pickled radish&amp;hellip; it can be soft and it can be crispy.&#xA;It is perhaps one of ingredients that is most ubiquitous in Taiwan.&#xA;– Yuguo&#xA;Image: The Daikon and the Baby by Helen Hyde.

      <description>我媽媽的越南菜 我的母親來自越南， 所以 當我吃到河粉、法國麵包（越南）、越南春捲時，我就會想起媽媽， 我甚至會去比較， 誰做得比較好吃。&#xA;不過並不是拿我媽做參考，我媽沒有做過河粉給我吃過。或是說：我沒有印象，可能有。反倒是她常做春捲、雞肉稀飯、生菜沙拉。 這三樣沒人能贏過她。&#xA;***— 張芳瑋 ***&#xA;My Mother&amp;rsquo;s Vietnamese Food My mother is from Vietnam, so when I eat phở, bánh mì, or Vietnamese spring rolls, I think of my mum. I even compare who makes them the best. But I don&amp;rsquo;t use my mum as a reference, because my mother has never made me phở to eat. Or, to put it another way, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any recollection of it, but perhaps she did.</description>

      <description>I have a complicated relationship with chai. Kenyan chai, not the Indian version. The milk is warmed first, before the water, the tea-dust — fragrant Kenyan tea from the Rift Valley highlands —, and the sugar are all added. It is all done by eye. I have never met a family who follows a recipe.&#xA;Chai is what we serve to guests. It is the first thing we have in the morning, and probably the last thing we have before sleeping.</description>

      <description>I remember my grandmother as both affectionate and strict. She had a tough exterior but a soft heart, and she expressed her love in every action. She never said the words, &amp;ldquo;I love you,&amp;rdquo; but everything she did was an embodiment of love.&#xA;Her love manifested in numerous ways — holding hands while crossing the street, the small lamp guiding me home after evening classes, the late-night bowl of noodles when we were hungry, the shell-less shrimp she prepared, the adhesive bandage that appeared instantly when I got hurt, and the scolding when I was careless.</description>

      <description>The food I like most is made by my grandpa. He used to make stewed pork rice (滷肉飯), one of the most famous dishes on Taiwanese dining tables. Every time I got home, the smell always made me happy and joyful.&#xA;Now grandpa is a sick, so it is our turn to cook for him. Although we can&amp;rsquo;t make our stewed pork rice taste the same as grandpa&amp;rsquo;s, I still think it is delicious: it is one of the most delicious dishes of all.</description>

      <description>Turnip cake (in Taiwanese, 菜頭粿 tshài-thâu-ké) is a staple of Taiwanese breakfast shops. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those comfort foods that is comforting because of its very simplicity. Taiwanese friends have told us that when they are elsewhere in the world, the thought of tshài-thâu-ké makes them go weak at the knees with nostalgia.&#xA;But if breakfast shop turnip cake is good, home-cooked turnip cake is so much better. So here&amp;rsquo;s a little story in Chinese from our afternoon tea workshop, about grandma&amp;rsquo;s home-cooked tshài-thâu-ké.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we held our afternoon tea event here at the Nanning Literary House. We designed this as an informal writing workshop, inviting friends and strangers into the literary house to eat home-made scones (we were busy all Sunday morning in the kitchen!), and to share stories about food.&#xA;We asked our visitors to write their stories — in English, Chinese, or any language they chose — on small cards, and we hung these outside the literary house for passers-by to read.</description>

      <description>My memories of carbonara are so rich and deep. It will always be my go-to food, until the day I die.&#xA;Everything started when I was a kid, and my mum used to cook carbonara for me, because it&amp;rsquo;s fast and cheap. Every Wednesday, she would pick us up at school and bring us back home to have lunch with her during her break. My brother and I would eat with her.</description>

      <description>No matter where I am, no matter how old I am, whenever I see mulberries I think of home.&#xA;The story began 50 years ago. As a child, I had lots of time for leisure activities. I climbed trees to pick fruit, played baseball and played marbles. But picking mulberries is the thing I remember most. Why? Because it was a chance for me, my cousins and my neighbors to get closer and share secrets and dreams.</description>

      <description>When the waitress began to speak, I looked closely at her face, and I noticed that she had the most unusual eyes.&#xA;I think she wore contact lenses because her eyes were blue, but not a crystal-like, light blue like I usually see at home: they were deep navy, almost purple. And I&amp;rsquo;d never seen eyes like that before.&#xA;— Hannah Stevens</description>

      <description>We were walking home late one evening when I saw it. It was a white sign with black writing that read &amp;lsquo;Cake&amp;rsquo; in English.&#xA;There was the image of a cat on the sign and the cat wore sunglasses. As we got closer I could smell the cake. It smelled of cooked sugar, beaten eggs, creamed butter.&#xA;We didn&amp;rsquo;t stop there that night but I want to go back.&#xA;— Hannah Stevens</description>

      <description>Tainan is a culinary heaven. It flourishes with lively, historic flavours. Every dish echoes the city&amp;rsquo;s rich heritage. Food in Tainan is a vibrant fusion of tradition and innovation on the taste buds.&#xA;Waking up in the morning, have a bowl of hot beef soup from the market, or a soul-soothing bowl of tender minced pork, to make you feel energetic.&#xA;After work in the morning, have a milkfish feast, especially the belly and skin.</description>

      <description>The custard tarts are deep, soft, still warm from the oven. We just bought them from a stall down the road. We take them from their ruffled paper cake-cups, bite in to them, slowly, carefully. The pastry crumbles. The custard is sweet and creamy. We eat them up in five bites.&#xA;Image by Paul Klee (1921): Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</description>

      <description>At dinner, we eat fish, and pork with strips of salted ginger, and water spinach. It is the first day of our residency, and we are celebrating with a beer.&#xA;The table next door is boisterous. There&amp;rsquo;s a large group of customers drinking whiskey. They are talking loudly in Taiwanese. I have become used to the sounds of the language. It feels familiar, even though I can only understand snippets. &amp;ldquo;Guá kā lí kóng&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I tell you&amp;hellip;.</description>

We like the idea of writing as an activity that can nourish us. And we&amp;rsquo;re intending to make use of this residency to nourish our own writing, and to explore the idea of nourishment more broadly.</description>

      <description>What could be better, first thing in the morning, than an egg pancake (蛋餅) from one of your favourite local breakfast shops? One of the perpetual dilemmas of living in Tainan is where to eat breakfast. It is a good dilemma to have. Here in the South District, we have an abundance of options: congee (粥), bao buns (包子), pot-stickers (國鐵), soft wraps (潤餅), egg pancakes (蛋餅)&amp;hellip; Or else, if we remember in time, we put a loaf of sourdough on to rise overnight, and when we get up, we stick it in our new box oven so that by breakfast time, the house is filled with the smell of baking bread.</description>

Premise is a community &amp;ldquo;where the curious come to connect, learn, and grapple with life’s enduring questions.&amp;rdquo; Premise is neither a book club nor a college-style course.
