## Safeguarding at Wind&Bones
This safeguarding policy applies to all staff, including volunteers and paid freelancers, or anyone working in any capacity on behalf of Wind&Bones CIC. 

At Wind&Bones we work with a wide variety of groups, including children, young people, and other vulnerable groups. We believe that
children, young people and other vulnerable groups should not experience abuse of any kind. We have a responsibility to promote and safeguard the welfare of all those with whom we work, and we are committed to practicing in a way that protects them from harm. 

We fully recognise our duty of care for those with whom we work, in line with the appropriate legislative frameworks. These include, but are not limited to: the United Nations Convention on the Rights
of the Child (UNCRC); the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act (2014); the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act (2007); the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (2018); the Equality Act (2010); and Getting it right for every child (GIRFEC).  

Our approach to Safeguarding is in line with the [Creating Safety](https://www.creativescotland.com/resources-publications/guides-toolkits/creating-safety) guidelines from Creative Scotland.

We are committed to protecting those with whom we work from abuse in all its forms: physical, emotion, sexual, or abuse through neglect. We are also committed to ongoing training that will ensure we maintain this commitment to our responsibilities, and to all the relevant legislative frameworks. 

We work on the following principles:

- Our first priority is the welfare of those with whom we work.
- All those with whom we work, regardless of sexuality, sexual identity, gender identity, language, racial or ethnic origin, age, culture, marital status, or religious beliefs have the right to protection from abuse.
- All any any concerns about abuse or allegations should be taken seriously and responded to in a fashion that is both timely and appropriate.
- All those with whom we work are entitled to being treated with respect and dignity.
- Bullying, in any form, cannot be tolerated.

In addition, we are committed to:

- Keeping informed about best practice and legislation in relation to safeguarding, both in Scotland and globally. 
- Ensuring that those we employ who work with vulnerable groups hold current DBS certificates in the UK, or equivalent in our projects elsewhere. 
- Appropriately risk-assessing all our activities, and taking all necessary action.
- For multi-partner projects, working with project partners to ensure that these principles are shared across by all parties. 
- At all times, following the Wind&Bones Code of Behaviour, in line also with Wind&Bones policies on [Equality, Inclusion and Diversity](/equalities).
