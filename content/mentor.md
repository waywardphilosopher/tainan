## Get help with your writing

Are you an academic wanting to write for a broader audience? A novelist working on your first book? A nonfiction writer unsure where to go next? At Wind&Bones, we offer mentoring for a diversity of writers, from absolute beginners to those with years of experience.

## How it works
We offer bespoke mentoring. Our services include:

- Reading and giving comprehensive feedback on your work
- Line-by-line editing
- Meeting online or face to face

If you are interseted in mentoring, the first stage is to [**get in touch**](/contact) to talk about what you are working on, and what help you need. Then we can design a mentoring package to suit you.

We've helped academics refine book proposals leading to successful publication. We've worked with writers to nurture their nonfiction and fiction projects to completion. And we've given advice and support to bestselling writers who have found themselves "stuck", and need an extra helping hand.

## What does it cost?
We charge a flat fee of £40 (1600 NTD) per hour. Every project is different. Once you get in touch, we can talk about the project you are working on, and what your needs are. Then we can design a package to help you reach your writing goals.

## Testimonials from people we have we worked with
Here are some of the nice things people are saying about us:

> Wind&Bones opened me up to a whole different mode of writing, which is so intimate and rewarding. It has given me another entry point into fiction and a better way to understand myself through writing about my own life. Hannah and Will are nothing but nurturing and warm. The course felt deeply transformative.
