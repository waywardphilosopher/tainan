## Overview
The Bioregional Weaving Labs Collective is an ambitious project of the [Ashoka foundation](https://www.ashoka.org/en-gb/program/bioregional-weaving-labs-collective) that aims to reweave connections between peoples, communities, cultures and the natural world. Waterford, Ireland, is one of the bioregions that is spearheading this exciting initiative.

Wind&Bones were invited to co-lead a workshop with Waterford's own "weaver", Dr. Sarah Prosser. We worked with local farmers, community members and consumers to write a manifesto for rethinking the centrality of food in our lives.
