## Overview
In the autumn of 2022, we worked with a Myanmar-based NGO and a group of community teachers on a project to develop storytelling skills in the classroom.

The teachers with whom we worked are continuing to provide education in the difficult post-coup landscape of Myanmar. We ran this project with a Myanmar-based NGO to explore how storytelling can be used as a pedagogical tool.

## Project Outcomes
We ran three workshops overall, exploring storytelling in theory and practice, and its pedagogical uses.

Because of the difficult security situation in contemporary Myanmar, we are unable to provide details of our project partners for this project or any direct links.
