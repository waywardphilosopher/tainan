## Overview
In 2023, we were awarded a Connections Through Culture grant for a pilot project working on cross-cultural creativity. Working with China-based academic and writer Dr Stephanie Lu, we ran a workshop for Chinese and English writers, writing responses to Liu Xie's medieval Chinese classic the Wenxin diaolong (文心雕龍), or *The Heart of Literature, the Carving of Dragons.*

Liu's book is a masterpiece of literary theory; but it is also more than this. It is an insightful and incisive philosophy of creativity. At Wind&Bones, we take our name from the chapter in the *Wenxin diaolong* on "wind and bones" (風骨).

## Project Outcomes
Six writers are taking part in the project. Each writer will be commissioned to write a response to a part of the *Wenxin diaolong*, and these responses will be cross-translated between English and Chinese.
