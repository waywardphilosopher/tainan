## Overview
In 2023, we were awarded a Connections Through Culture grant for a pilot project working on cross-cultural creativity. Working with China-based academic and writer Dr Sipei Lu, we are running a workshop for Chinese and English writers, exploring Liu Xie's medieval Chinese classic the Wenxin diaolong (文心雕龍), or *The Heart of Literature, the Carving of Dragons.*

Liu's book is a masterpiece of literary theory; but it is also more than this. It is an insightful and incisive philosophy of creativity. At Wind&Bones, we take our name from the chapter in the *Wenxin diaolong* on "wind and bones" (風骨).

After the workshop, we are commissioning six new works of literature, to be translated and published in both English and Chinese.
