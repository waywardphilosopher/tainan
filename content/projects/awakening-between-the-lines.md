## Overview
We worked with the Emprove Foundation and British Embassy, Bulgaria, on an innovative project to raise awareness of the issue of domestic abuse. Emprove Foundation work with women survivors of abuse. For this project, we ran a six-week intensive workshop on writing for a group of women survivors.

The stories were edited into final form and cross-translated between Bulgarian and English. We also worked closely with Bulgarian poet Nadezhda Radulova on the translations. The final stories were exhibited alongside commissioned artworks at the National Gallery of Bulgaria. The stories were also published as a boxed set of story cards.

## Project Outcomes
### Exhibition at the National Gallery of Bulgaria Kvadrat 500
In the summer of 2022, the National Gallery of Bulgaria held a two-month-long exhibition called *Awakening Between the Lines / Пробуждане между редовете*, exhibiting the stories in Bulgarian and English and the commissioned artworks.

### Story cards
The stories have now been published as a boxed set of cards. On the front of the cards are the commissioned illustrations, and on the back of the cards are the stories in both languages. The cards can be used for training and educational purposes.
