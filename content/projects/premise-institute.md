## Overview

In the spring of 2023, we're partnering with the Premise Institute, based over in the promised land of literature that is Portland, Oregon. Premise is a community "where the curious come to connect, learn, and grapple with lifeâ€™s enduring questions." Premise is neither a book club nor a college-style course. Instead, it is a chance to explore wide-ranging questions about human life, based on the shared experience of reading.

We're starting off our collaboration with a session on *Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World,* by Wind&Bones's very own Will Buckingham. 

Will is on the Premise advisory board, and we're excited to be working together.
