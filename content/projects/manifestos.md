## Overview
We were invited to the 2019 EmpathEAST forum for Empathy-driven Social Change in Plovdiv, Bulgaria to talk about our Wind&Bones work.

The three-day forum was a gathering of social activists, changemakers, artists and academics, all interested in exploring the ways in which it might be possible to bring about positive social change.

We gave a talk to the delegates (see the link below) and ran our first ever manifesto-writing workshop. We have gone on to develop this work on manifesto-writing with projects in Ireland, Myanmar and elsewhere.
