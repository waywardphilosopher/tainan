## Info 
- Project date: 2019
- Project location: Yangon, Myanmar
- Project partners: Paung Ku, Myanmar.

## Overview
In 2019, we ran a three-day workshop with staff from the Myanmar civil society organisation, Paung Ku, who are an organisation committed to driving positive social change. Paung Khu's vision is of a pluralistic society that values the diversity of ethnicity, culture and belief in Myanmar, and that ensures equity and respect for the rights of all, particularly those who are marginalised.

We worked with a group of Paung Ku staff, exploring how they can craft compelling storytelling strategies to get their message out!
