This weekend we're getting started on our new project with Bulgaria's Emprove Foundation, working on a storytelling project with women survivors of domestic abuse.

The project is funded by British Embassy, Sofia, and is the first of its kind in Bulgaria. We'll be working intensively with a group of women survivors over a period of six weeks, developing skills in storytelling, and giving shape to an exciting new publiction in both Bulgarian and English languages, due out in 2022.

The course is timed to tie in with the UN's [International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women](https://www.un.org/en/observances/ending-violence-against-women-day). Data from the previous year and a half has shown that since the beginning of Covid-19, domestic violence and abuse has intensified across the world. UN Women refer to this as a "Shadow Pandemic". 

Our aim with this collaboration is to increase awareness of domestic abuse here in Bulgaria, to empower the women survivors who take part, and to train Emprove staff in techniques in facilitating storytelling sessions, so that they can develop this work further within the Bulgarian context.

The eventual publication is going to be beautiful: we're brimming over with ideas here! And the women survivors will also be working with artists and illustrators to help bring their stories and their voices into the public domain. Because this is the first step towards change.
