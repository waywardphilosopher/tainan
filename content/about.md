## Writing and storytelling for social change.

Wind&Bones is a social enterprise dedicated to exploring the many ways in which writing can lead to positive social change. Run by writers Dr Hannah Stevens & Dr Will Buckingham. Based in Dundee, Scotland, we work across the globe.

We work with organisations and individuals to explore the transformative power of writing and storytelling.

## Who we are

We are Dr Hannah Stevens and Dr Will Buckingham.

Hannah has a PhD in creative writing. She is an internationally published writer of both fiction and non-fiction. She has over a decade of experience working with community groups and grassroots charities, and has worked on projects for organisations including the BBC and Greenpeace.

Hannah's most recent book is *In their Absence* (Roman Books 2021), a collection of short stories about missing people, and those they leave behind. *In their Absence* was based on Hannah's PhD research. The stories testify to the complexity and diversity of the reasons that lead to people going missing.

Will has a PhD in philosophy. He is the author of 13 books with publishers including Granta, Hachette and Knopf. His most recent book is *Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World* (Granta 2021/2), which was a BBC Radio4 Book of the Week. Will has been involved in writing projects for a wide range of organisations including the NHS and the BBC, and was formerly Associate Professor in Writing & Creativity at De Montfort University.
