Our project with the [Emprove Foundation](https://emproveproject.eu/) working with women survivors of domestic abuse on storytelling for social change is currently going from strength to strength. We've been hard at work editing an array of brilliant, creative and incredibly diverse survivor micro-stories, to be published this summer in both Bulgarian and English.  The project is part of a larger initiative called #ArtAwakens (\#ИзкуствотоПробужда in Bulgarian), spanning art-forms from film to literature, and from visual arts to design. 

There will be events in Sofia, Bulgaria to mark International Women's day, a short story contest in Bulgarian, for women survivors (with the brilliant poet, our friend Nadezhda Radulova, on the judging panel), a public exhibition at the National Gallery Kvadrat 500 in Sofia, a series of literary readings and public dicussions, and finally a big launch party thanks to our partners at British Embassy, Sofia. 

If you want to find out more about this exciting project, you can download the project brochure here (PDF opens in a new tab). The brochure is designed by the wonderful Teyah L Mine.
