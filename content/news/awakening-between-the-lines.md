We're incredibly excited to see the next phase of our project with the Emprove Foundation in Sofia, Bulgaria.

Late last year, we worked with a group of women survivors of domestic abuse on crafting powerful micro-stories about empowerment, creativity and positive change. The stories were no more than 90 words long, and are to be published on beautiful story cards in both Bulgarian and English. Our good friend, the brilliant Bulgarian poet Nadezhda Radulova is working on the Bulgarian versions, and some of Bulgaria's most brilliant artists, illustrators and designers have been commissioned to illustrate the stories.

In this next phase of the project, these illustrations are to be at the heart of an exhibition   called Пробуждане Между Редовете / Awakening Between the Lines at the National Gallery Kvadrat 500 in Sofia, from May 17th 2020 to 17th July.

We're going to be heading out to Bulgaria to see the exhibition. And if you are in Sofia, you should definitely have a look. Here's the poster, which we love:
