## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

Our approach to data collection is that we collect the minimum amount of  data to make this website work, and no more. There are several ways we  do this. The main ones are these:

- This site runs using Hugo, which makes it lightweight and very privacy-aware. 
- If you sign up for the newsletter, we will  use your email address to send out our irregular mailings. You will need to double opt-in to the email, and you can unsubscribe at any time. 
- We collect visitor analytics through [**Plausible**](https://plausible.io), a privacy-focussed GDPR-compliant alternative to Google Analytics.  Unlike Google Analytics, Plausible do not track, collect or store any  personal data or personally identifiable information.
- We collect data from the contact form, including your name/pseudonym, email and  the content of any message. The contact form collects minimal  information, so nothing is recorded other than these details.

## What rights you have over your data

You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you.  This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for legal or  security purposes.
