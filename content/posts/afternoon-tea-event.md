Yesterday we held our [afternoon tea](/afternoon-tea) event here at the Nanning Literary House. We designed this as an informal writing workshop, inviting friends and strangers into the literary house to eat home-made scones (we were busy all Sunday morning in the kitchen!), and to share stories about food. 

We asked our visitors to write their stories — in English, Chinese, or any language they chose — on small cards, and we hung these outside the literary house for passers-by to read.

There were some truly lovely stories, and we'll be uploading them over the coming few days. We've also had lots of glimpses into the food culture of Tainan, Taiwan and beyond. But more than this, our afternoon tea workshop was a chance for visitors to make new connections, and to share new ideas. 

Oh, and by mid-way through the afternoon, our small mountain of scones had entirely disappeared. Because you can't write and tell stories on an empty stomach.
