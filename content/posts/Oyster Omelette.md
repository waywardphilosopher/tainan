I think the food that makes me most homesick is oyster omelette. For me, the reason Oyster Omelette is special is because this the first time my mother cooked anything other than poached eggs together, this is what we cooked.

Although it looks terrible, it nevertheless tastes delicious. I like it a lot, but it also brings me valuable memories with my mom.
