Two days before Christmas, we wrapped up our project with a final lecture generously hosted by the StableNice Café here in Tainan. We drank tea, ate cake, talked about our work at Wind&Bones, shared some of the stories from the project, and talked about what we had learned over the ten days of our residency.

We also spent some time encouraging guests to get involved by sharing stories of their own. This made for a wonderfully moving afternoon — a shared feast of stories, food and friendship.

You can see some of the photos from our final lecture below:
