## 蘿蔔
蘿蔔是台式食物的基本班底。 是低調溫潤的和聲。蘿蔔糕、蘿蔔絲餅、蘿蔔飯、雞湯、蔬菜湯、醃蘿蔔， 可以柔軟也能爽脆。大概是最台南的食材之一，無處不在。

## Radish

Radish is the fundamental ingredient of Taiwanese food. It is a subdued and gentle harmony. Radish cake, grated radish patties, radish rice, chicken soup, vegetable soup, pickled radish... it can be soft and it can be crispy.

It is perhaps one of ingredients that is most ubiquitous in Taiwan.
