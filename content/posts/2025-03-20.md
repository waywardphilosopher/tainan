We were an Ecuadorian city man, a mountain llama farmer, four Americans and one Brit wild hiking all day at about 4,000 metres elevation. I was cooking our evening meal, and suspicion was everywhere. It was vegan. An Indian curry. They saw with alarm the fruit being added to the veg: ripe bananas, apple, sultanas. Plus a handful of cashew nuts. This has to be bad!

Then they tasted it. *Heaven*. Not a scrap left, and the story became part of our hiking community legends.
