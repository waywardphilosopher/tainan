It was my father who taught me to cook. In my family he prepared meals for all of us — breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is very different from a traditional Asian family. 

The reason my father started to cook was because he wanted to reproduce the dishes made by his father, our grandpa. My father's father passed away in my father's early childhood. I never knew him.

Since learning why my father cooked, I have asked him to teach me some basic cooking skills. It's so important to preserve the taste of our own home-cooked meals, to pass them down the generations.
