We ended 2023 with a ten-day residency at the Nanning Literary House (南寧文學·家), where we ran a project called **滋養台南 | Nourishing Tainan**. We spent ten days working on our writing, and also working with members of the public to write stories about the things that nourish us: the food that nourishes our bodies, the stories that nourish our spirit, and the ideas that nourish our imagination. You can see the project website [here](https://nanning.windandbones.com). 

As a part of the residency, we held a public [afternoon tea event](https://nanning.windandbones.com/post/afternoon-tea-event/), where we invited passers-by to come and drink tea, eat home-made scones, and share their stories. And we finished the residency with [a public workshop at the StableNice Café](https://nanning.windandbones.com/post/2024-01-04-banquet/), to share our insights and stories — as well as to encourage those who came along to share their own stories.

It was a real pleasure to work with the many writers and storytellers whom we met over the course of the ten days. And — as relatively new arrivals here in Tainan — it was a delightful way to make new connections. Because nothing connects like a cup of tea, and a shared story.
