Last weekend, we spent three days in an unexpectedly sunny Glasgow at the Dandelion Festival, a part of the UK-wide Unboxed Festival.

Dandelion is about deepening our relationship with the natural world, about the joy of growing, and about thinking more deeply about where our food comes from.

So over the course of the weekend, we were in a potting shed — a little wooden hut — asking people to share their own stories about food: the food they love, the food they hate, the food they like to cook, the food that has caused them to fall in and out of love, the food that reminds them of home.

Here are some pictures from the weekend. And if you want to read some of the stories, you can [go to our Online Story Garden](https://dandelion.windandbones.com/) to read more. Or the [project page](/projects/dandelion-festival/) on this site.
