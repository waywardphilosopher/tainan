Earlier this week, Wind&Bones were in the wonderfully laid-back city of Taitung, where we invited to give a talk at [國立臺東大學 National Taitung University](https://www.nttu.edu.tw) on social entrepreneurship. It was also the first time we have talked publicly about our work in Chinese, which was very exciting (and not a little nerve-wracking).

During the lecture, we discussed our work at Wind&Bones, and how we use writing and storytelling to bring about positive social change. We talked about the origins of Wind&Bones, our [first-ever workshop](https://www.windandbones.com/projects/write-here/), [how we got our name,](https://www.windandbones.com/posts/why-wind-and-bones/) some of our [favourite projects](https://www.windandbones.com/projects/), and our upcoming residency at the Tainan Nanning Literature House (南寧文學·家). 

We had so many questions from students about writing, about leading an organisation, about inspiration, about social change, and about how we keep positive when there's so much suffering in the world. 

We're grateful to Dr. Ching-yueh Hsieh for inviting us and making us feel so welcome. And to the students who attended and made it such an enjoyable experience.
