When we started this website, it was just a small project for our residency at the Nanning Literature House in December 2023. But since then, there has been a lot of interest from people wanting to share their stories. So we thought it was time we gave the website a bit of a new look.

We're still finishing off our refurbishment, so some things may still not work perfectly, but we like the new colour scheme and typography. We've got a bunch of new stories to upload as well, from our recent visit to the National Tainan Chia Chi Senior High School 國立臺南家齊高級中等學校 , so keep your eyes peeled.
