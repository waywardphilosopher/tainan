I'm a big foodie, so I frequently fall in love with food. And of all the foods I have ever eaten, *zongzi* is the best. Before the annual Dragon Boat Festival coming,  my grandmother is always busy. She needs to wrap over two hundred *zongzi* for my family and friends. As she wraps them, she patiently teaches me. It's a technical challenge to wrap them perfectly and quickly.

Inside the *zongzi* are sticky rice, peanuts, marinated pork, and dried shrimp. And in every batch, there is only one with a salted egg yolk. The one with the yolk is valuable. It is a sign of good fortune.

*Zongzi* are delicious, but sticky rice is hard to digest. I have to stop myself from overeating!
