When the waitress began to speak, I looked closely at her face, and I noticed that she had the most unusual eyes.

I think she wore contact lenses because her eyes were blue, but not a crystal-like, light blue like I usually see at home: they were deep navy, almost purple. And I'd never seen eyes like that before.
