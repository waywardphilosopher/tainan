When my clan was still intact, my grandpa was still alive, my dad and uncle had not yet broken up their affection, my family always had a big meal on Chinese New Year. This feast was the one I most looked forward to every year.

Dumplings are the food which best represent home. Dumplings are a dish that everyone in the family learned how to cook: my grandma, dad, mom, my elder brother and sister, and me.

It was my elder brother who taught me to cook dumplings, when my clan was still intact.
