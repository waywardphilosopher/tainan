My memories of carbonara are so rich and deep. It will always be my go-to food, until the day I die.

Everything started when I was a kid, and my mum used to cook carbonara for me, because it's fast and cheap. Every Wednesday, she would pick us up at school and bring us back home to have lunch with her during her break. My brother and I would eat with her. For the rest of the week, we would wait impatiently for Wednesday, when we could skip the school restaurant (it always tasted so bad) to have mum's wonderful pasta. It came with the good vibes and joyful atmosphere my mum brings everywhere she goes.

Every Wednesday, the same moment of happiness. But each time unique. I guess that's what Japanese call "ichi go ichi e" (一期一会).

Then we grew up and became students. And carbonara became our go-to food. It is affordable, quick to cook, so good to eat, and makes us feel full and happy!

Today, every time we have the opportunity to cook together, my brother and I compete to show who has the best cooking skills and who's recipe is the most flavourful!

That's a lot of memories, a lot of feelings of love for something that is just the meeting of pasta, egg yolk, parmesan cheese, and pork — and nothing more!
