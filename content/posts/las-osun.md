It is seven years ago that we ran our first storytelling workshop with Wind&Bones. Our first ever workshop was a multilingual workshop with asylum-seekers and refugees in Leicester, UK. It was a sheer, boisterous delight, held in a community hall in the centre of town. We wrote and shared stories in multiple languages, while at the same time there was an exercise class going on in another corner of the hall, and lunch being served in yet another corner.

Since then, our own understanding of storytelling and the power of storytelling has increased immeasurably. So we're delighted that Wind&Bones's [Dr Will Buckingham](https://www.willbuckingham.com) has been commissioned to write a Liberal Arts and Sciences Strengthening Guide on storytelling for the [Open Society University Network](https://opensocietyuniversitynetwork.org) (OSUN). 

OSUN is a global network of higher education institutions  committed to the idea that the primary role of education is to support open societies. These are societies based on democratic practice, sustainability, addressing inequalities, a commitment to human rights and global justice, the promotion of global public health, and a commitment to the pivotal role played by the arts. Both Will and Hannah from Wind&Bones work for Parami University, a part of the OSUN network — Hannah in the Insitute of Continuing Education, and Will in the Institute of Undergraduate Studies. 

The guide is called *Storytelling in the Multilingual and Multicultural Classroom: Community, Communication, Confidence, and Connection*, and will be available some time next year. It will give us the chance to share the fruits of our work over the past seven years with educators across the OSUN network. Over this time, we've developed some powerful methods for working on storytelling across differences of language and culture. We have run projects in Myanmar, Indonesia, Taiwan, Bulgaria, Scotland, England, Ireland and elsewhere, and we have met some astonishing, wonderful, and deeply committed storytellers, activists, writers, and champions of social justice. So we're looking forward to drawing together some of these insights and experiences into a guide that can inspire others to use storytelling to bring about positive change.
