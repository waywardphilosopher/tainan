It is seven years ago that we ran our first storytelling workshop with Wind&Bones. Our first ever workshop was a multilingual workshop with asylum-seekers and refugees in the British city of Leicester. It was a sheer, boisterous delight, held in a community hall in the centre of town. We wrote and shared stories in multiple languages, while at the same time there was an exercise class going on in another corner of the hall, and lunch being served in yet another corner.

Since then, our own understanding of storytelling and the power of storytelling has increased immeasurably. So we're delighted that Wind&Bones's [Dr Will Buckingham](https://www.willbuckingham.com) has been commissioned to write a Liberal Arts and Sciences Strengthening Guide on storytelling for the [Open Society University Network](https://opensocietyuniversitynetwork.org). The guide is called *Storytelling in the Multilingual and Multicultural Classroom: Community, Communication, Confidence, and Connection*, and should be available some time next year. 

We're also excited to have the chance to think through what we have learned over the past seven years, and to draw some of those insights together into a form that will be useful to others.
