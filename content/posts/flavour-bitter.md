## 一股連我也不知道是什麼的滋味，從裡向外展開

我會注意到那攤子，是因為所有人似乎都急切的想要無視它。賣仙草茶的老人衝著行人笑，笑的有點不知所措。

我拉著媽直直走向攤子。「一杯！」

老人怔了怔才把茶給我。過時的東西賣久了，連他也差點無視了自己的存在。我喝了一口沒人要的茶。苦！

「好喝嗎？」我媽遲疑地問。

「我們買一瓶回家！」老人笑開了花。

我又喝了一口。

## A flavour even I don't know

A flavour — even I don't know what it is — unfolds from the inside outwards.

The reason I noticed the stall was because everyone else seemed eager to ignore it. The old man selling grass jelly tea smiled at passersby. His smile seemed a little awkward.

I pulled my mum straight towards the stall. "Just one cup!"

The old man hesitated before giving me the tea. Having sold these outdated things for so long, he seemed to barely register their existence.

I took a sip of this tea that nobody wanted. It was bitter!

"Is it good?" asked my mum hesitantly.

"Let's buy a bottle to take home!"

The old man burst into a smile. I took another sip.
