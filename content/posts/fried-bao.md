## Fried Bao
I get to the fried bao stall too late. "Sold out," the boss tells me.

The next day, I am up extra early. When I arrive at the fried bao stall, the boss looks pleased. Some of these foreigners learn fast. "Today," she says, "you have come on time"

I buy six. To celebrate.

## 煎包

當我到達煎包攤車的時候，已經太晚了。老闆娘對我說：「賣光了！」

第二天，我比較早起床。當我到達煎包攤車時，老闆娘看起來很滿意。有些外國人學得很快。她說：「今天準時來了！」
我買了六個，為了慶祝。
