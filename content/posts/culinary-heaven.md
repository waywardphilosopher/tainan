Tainan is a culinary heaven. It flourishes with lively, historic flavours. Every dish echoes the city's rich heritage. Food in Tainan is a vibrant fusion of tradition and innovation on the taste buds.

Waking up in the morning, have a bowl of hot beef soup from the market, or a soul-soothing bowl of tender minced pork, to make you feel energetic. 

After work in the morning, have a milkfish feast, especially the belly and skin. The owners of the fish shop will clean the skins and the entrails, and add onions and ginger so you can just open your mouth and eat.

At 5:30 in the afternoon, just ride a scooter or take a walk down the road, and there are food-stands in the bustling streets. You can eat oyster omelette, tofu pudding, mochi, rice cakes, pineapple cakes, and red bean soup.

At night, it's a precious time for the family to gather round and enjoy an abundance of food.

People in Tainan never get hungry or tired. We just eat — from the first moment we wake until when we go to bed.

Then there is the indispensable Tainan drink: black tea.

Whenever I leave Tainan for other places, the thing I worry about most is food. When I am away, I can't stop thinking of the food back home. Because here in Tainan, I'm always excited about the next meal.
