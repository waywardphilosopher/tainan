Last summer, we worked with GIY (Ireland), Ashoka, and the wonderful Dr. Sarah Prosser on a project to develop a manifesto for future food in the Waterford Bioregion. We co-ran a workshop with local farmers, community members and consumers, leading to the drafting of a manifesto for rethinking the centrality of food in all of our lives.

You can read more about the project here: [Waterford Manifesto](https://www.windandbones.com/projects/waterford-manifesto/). 

We're delighted that the manifesto is now available on YouTube, read by Ray McGrath, who took part in the workshop. Here is an extract:

> We want a world where everything is connected, from rocks to the human heart. \
> We want our children and grandchildren to know the taste of wild salmon. \
> We want to be good guardians of the soil and of our traditions. \
> We want to become good ancestors.
