The food I like most is made by my grandpa. He used to make stewed pork rice (滷肉飯), one of the most famous dishes on Taiwanese dining tables. Every time I got home, the smell always made me happy and joyful. 

Now grandpa is a  sick, so it is our turn to cook for him. Although we can't make our stewed pork rice taste the same as grandpa's, I still think it is delicious: it is one of the most delicious dishes of all. I hope that grandpa thinks the same.
