## 我媽媽的越南菜

我的母親來自越南， 所以 當我吃到河粉、法國麵包（越南）、越南春捲時，我就會想起媽媽， 我甚至會去比較， 誰做得比較好吃。

不過並不是拿我媽做參考，我媽沒有做過河粉給我吃過。或是說：我沒有印象，可能有。反倒是她常做春捲、雞肉稀飯、生菜沙拉。 這三樣沒人能贏過她。

## My Mother's Vietnamese Food

My mother is from Vietnam, so when I eat *phở*, *bánh mì*, or Vietnamese spring rolls, I think of my mum. I even compare who makes them the best. But I don't use my mum as a reference, because my mother has never made me *phở* to eat. Or, to put it another way, I don't have any recollection of it, but perhaps she did. 

However, she often makes spring rolls, chicken rice gruel, and lettuce salad. And,in making these three dishes, nobody can surpass her.
