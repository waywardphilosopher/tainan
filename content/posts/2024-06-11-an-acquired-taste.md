When it comes to local snacks in Taiwan, stinky tofu will definitely come to mind, but is it a mouth-watering delicacy, or is it a disgusting food that smells like stinking ditches?

I think that although stinky tofu is pungent and unpleasant, the crispy skin paired with pickled cabbage and sauce is simply delicious the moment you put it in your mouth. The streets of Tainan are full of such affordable delicacies that make you want to try again and again.
