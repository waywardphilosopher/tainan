When it comes to eating something special, I think of nothing but pork braised rice. Why? Because my mum is really good at cooking it.

Pork braised rice always brings me warm and happy memories. The colour, the smell, the taste — it always arouses my appetite.

Wherever I am, I cannot forget pork braised rice.
