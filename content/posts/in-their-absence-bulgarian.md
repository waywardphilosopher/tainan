Wind&Bones were based in Bulgaria for over two years, and so we are particularly delighted to see Hannah Stevens's brilliant short story collection, *In Their Absence* being released in a Bulgarian language edition, translated by Ana Pipeva.

The translation, Когато ги няма (*Kogato gi nyama*), is published by Altera, and has already attracted significant media attention.  

If you speak Bulgarian, have a listen in here on [Bulgarian National Radio](https://bnr.bg/post/101834399). And if you want to buy the book, [this is the link](https://m.helikon.bg/240094-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%B3%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%BC%D0%B0.html)
