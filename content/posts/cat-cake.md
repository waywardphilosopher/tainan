We were walking home late one evening when I saw it. It was a white sign with black writing that read 'Cake' in English. 

There was the image of a cat on the sign and the cat wore sunglasses. As we got closer I could smell the cake. It smelled of cooked sugar, beaten eggs, creamed butter.

We didn't stop there that night but I want to go back.
